            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough that which I here preſent thee with may look like a Novelty, yet I hope it will appear to be a truth of great Antiquity; for though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have not met with any that have treated thus diſtinctly of the ſeveral Ranks and Degrees of Saints, yet I cannot ſay but I was led to the conſideration thereof by perſons both Antient and Modern of great name and worth, who have now and then hinted that in their writings, which gave me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make a more full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into this thing, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to Preach upon it many
<pb facs="tcp:43845:4"/>years ago in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and I bleſs God, not without good acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſucceſs, as I have not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cauſe to preſume. As to the three firſt States I have ſpoken largely, but very little of the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> of Fathers, not willing to venture beyond my line or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, only hinting in General what may be gather'd from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Concerning them what I have ſaid, I ſubmit to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Elders and betters, who I hope will find me moderate and modeſt in my Aſſertions, and that they are conſonant to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Faith and agreeable to the tenor of Scripture both truths and expreſſions. I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of it, for I hope it will ſpeak for it ſelf, only my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to God are that it may be bleſt to every Reader, for their

            <head>This following Advertiſement was intended as an Epiſtle to the Reader before the Author's own was found.</head>
            <p>THis Treatiſe as it is now publiſhed, was ſo left by the worthy Author when he went to his reſt. The excellency and uſefulneſs of it will evidence it ſelf beſt in the peruſal thereof. It hath this prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence beyond many of the practical Diſcourſes that have of late paſſed the Preſs; that its deſign is ſingular and not managed (at leſt to ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement) by any before it.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral Degrees and Eſtates of Chriſtians, through which they paſs up to the meaſure and ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, are here inſiſted on, and with great experience, according to the rule of Faith explicated with perſpicuity.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the Diſcourſe is ſpent upon thoſe that make up the greateſt part of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> the weak ones or Babes, wherein will be found things of a comfortable concernment, and conducing very much to the eſtabliſhing of them; and promoting their advance to a greater degree of grace till they come to the aſſurance of the Love of God by the witneſs of the Spirit, which the Children enjoy. What is laid down in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="tcp:43845:6"/>to the witneſs of the Spirit, though ſome may differ in their conceptions from it, yet ſuch is the boundary and cautions here annexed to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular by the Author againſt deluſions, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will have a reaſonable ground to make any exceptions.</p>
            <p>What is performed in the handling of the temptations which attend the Young men, ſuch as have attained to a ſtrength of grace (whereby they are made conformable to Chriſt, who was in all things tempted as we are, yet without ſin) will be of great encouragement to many in their preſent warfare.</p>
            <p>As to the laſt Eſtate of Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Author hath diſcourſed very little, who though thoſe that were acquainted with him, might judge him to have attained to that degree of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianty, which lies in the higheſt experience of the myſteries of the Goſpel yet he through modeſty leaves that for others to ſupply and make up.</p>
            <p>And ſo you have the firſt remains of that good man, who was ſerviceable to Chriſt in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>The ſpiritual advantage of Chriſtians is all that is aimed at in the publication thereof, and accordingly is recommended to them by the Authors very good friends,</p>

Or perfect and Babes, as 'tis <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.13, 14. The Scriptures quoted do undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſſert, and experience confirms it: and why there may not be more than two ſorts, I can ſee no reaſon to diſ-believe, but there ſeems to me a great deal of reaſon for the belief of it; The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> naming three (Fathers, Young men and Children) and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> names a fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> Babes; for though they be as carnal, yet they are in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. but a degree below Children; as I think to make apparent in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>
               <p>To clear the way, I ſhall examine this Text, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. Which whether it denote and aſſert diſtinct Claſſes or kinds of Saints is yet the queſtion.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43845:7"/>the Scripture doth not meaſure them by that, but by this rule; or elſe there could not be any gradual Apoſtaſie in any Saints, as there was in them of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Revel.</hi> 2. or any ſtanding (as 'twere) at a ſtay, as it ſeems to be with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. So that their meaſure is to be taken by their attainments and proficiency, not by their years;
<note place="margin">See Wiſd; 4.8, 9.</note> (for though with the ancient there (uſually) is wiſdom, yet gray hairs are not always wiſe; which made <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeak as he did, <hi>Job</hi> 32.7, 9. The wiſe are always old, but the old are not always wiſe:) 'tis not how long they have ſtood, or how many years they have been in Chriſt, but their injoyments, experiences, proficiency and fruitfulneſs that denominates one above another: ſome may be in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, who yet may be out-grown by others, that came in long after them; as moſt of the elder Diſciples were out-grown by <hi>Paul</hi> a younger Brother, a Poſt-hume,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.8, 9, 10.</note> one born out of due time (as he ſpeaks of himſelf) who yet labour'd more abundantly than they all: ſo, many that are laſt ſhall be firſt. Some that are young for years, may be Fathers for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences and attainments, when others that are old and aged as to time, may be but young and raw in knowledge and practice. Some are but children when they are old, and others may be men, when they are but young; as <hi>Timothy</hi> was, who knew the Scriptures from (the cradle and from the breaſt as 'twere, or from) a child. Some are but like <hi>David,</hi> a youth and ſtripling, and yet of more true valor
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43845:8"/>and worth than <hi>Goliah</hi> who was a man of war from his youth, that I may ſpeak by alluſion. The Apoſtle tells us of ſome that for their time (if that had been the meaſure) might have been Teachers of others (might have attained to a great degree) but were ſuch Punies and Babes, that they needed to learn the A. B. C. of Religion; they were dull of hearing, had very weak ſtomachs and an ill digeſtion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. From whence this clearly and roundly follows, that a man, many men, may be of long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt, may be old (Fathers) for years, and yet be but Babes for underſtanding and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to digeſt the ſtrong meat of the Goſpel: Whereas other men, that are but Babes for time, but newly-new-born, may be men in Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> was in a little time, according to that phraſe of his, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. if I may ſo apply it: and out of the mouths of ſuch (for their time but Babes and Sucklings) there may be more perfect praiſe, than from elder Perſons, men of many years ſtanding.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, gray hairs found in a way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs are a Crown of glory (and uſually the elder the wine is, the better) and as to many of Gods Saints, their works have been more at laſt than at firſt, and their latter end better than their beginning: Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> Father <hi>Job,</hi> Father <hi>Moſes,</hi> Father <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome others were Fathers not only for age but grace: in <hi>Act.</hi> 21.16. there is mention made of one <hi>Mnaſon,</hi> an old Diſciple, who was (another <hi>Gaius</hi>) an entertainer of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Saints; but he is not called an old Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43845:8"/>meerly (as I ſuppoſe) for his years or age, but that he was as much a Diſciple as he was old (from his new birth) his Diſcipleſhip, ſaith and obedience ran along and kept pace with his age, that as he grew in years, ſo be he did in grace; he was an old Diſciple, a good proficient in the School of Chriſt. 'Twas a great commendation to <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia,</hi> not only that they were in Chriſt before <hi>Paul,</hi> but that they were of note, eminent, ſignal and of renown, <hi>viz.</hi> for their religion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. Glorious (becauſe gracious) things are ſpoken of old <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Luk. 1.6, 7. And 'twas the great praiſe of the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> that her laſt works were more than her firſt. But though it were thus with ſome, 'twas not ſo with all that were of equal age and ſtanding with theſe: for ſome were ever learning and learnt but little, ever doing yet did but little; the widows mite was more than theirs that caſt in much; <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that had but little ſtrength did effectually do more, than <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of whom greater things are ſpoken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.8. with <hi>ch.</hi> 2.2, 3. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in Chriſt is not a man in Chriſt Jeſus, but a child it may be, or perhaps but a Babe.

               <p>But I proceed to <hi>Verſe</hi> 13, 14. where we have three diſtincts Claſſes or States of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, with the proper and peculiar Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is the character of each of them. 1. <hi>The Fathers,</hi> who had the knowledge (the moſt exact and perfect knowledge) of him who was from the beginning, that is Chriſt Jeſus, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1. with <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2. The ancient of days, the everlaſting Father, as Chriſt is called, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9, 13, 22. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. Who is the ſame to day as yeſterday and will be for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. The Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, which is and which was and which is to come <hi>Jehova, Rev.</hi> 1.8. 'Tis <hi>q. d.</hi> you are well acquainted with his ſeveral diſpenſations and workings from firſt to laſt. And this is repeated, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. Secondly, <hi>The Young-men</hi> of whom 'tis ſaid, that they have overcome the wicked one; and <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. that they were ſtrong, that the word of God did abide in them, (<hi>viz.</hi> in ſtrength, like <hi>Joſephs</hi> bow, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.24. and) that they had overcome the wicked one. Thirdly, <hi>The little Children,</hi> of whom 'tis ſaid that they have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43845:10"/>known the Father; <hi>viz.</hi> as their heavenly Father who hath loved them.</p>
               <p>This is the ſumm of theſe Verſes; which Interpreters generally underſtand to be ſpoken of all the orders of Chriſtians, and that there are no other than what are comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe three names, <hi>viz.</hi> that all Saints are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little Children, or Young-men, or Father-Saints: but with ſubmiſſion I conceive that there is a fourth, inferior to, or younger than the youngeſt of theſe, who are (and are called) Babes, who do not (as ſuch and as yet) know the Father; as the little Children are ſaid to do. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> doth render <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Babes, as the vulgar Latine doth, <hi>infantes;</hi> but ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſaith <hi>Eraſmus, Inſans</hi> a Babe is by the Greeks called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; by which laſt word the Babe-Saint is expreſt in Scripture, again and again, and is of a lower form than the little Children, as God willing ſhall be made to appear hereafter, when I come to handle the Characteriſtical differences of each ſtate. Of which for the preſent I hint only this in the General, that the Fathers are ſo called (whether elder or younger for years) from their great experience and wiſdom, having gone through each of the inferior States; the Young-men are denominated from their ſtrength (of faith) whereby they overcome the evil or wicked one; the little Children have their Character from knowing the Father, which notes a ſtate of aſſurance; and the Babes from eating milk, the firſt principles, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43845:10"/>repentance, ſaith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with deſires after growth; all which is evident from the ſeveral places of Scripture, where theſe diſtinct Claſſes and forms are mentioned, and that under theſe very names, all which we ſhall examine God willing in the following treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Having thus given a general account of my intendment and deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> to treat of the ſeveral Claſſes and forms (if I may ſo ſpeak) of Saints, I ſhall for the preſent, make ſome general application of the whole, and ſpeak a little firſt to all, and then to every one, of theſe. <hi>To all.</hi> 1. Love one another without diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, unfeignedly, and with a pure heart ſervently, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. but love not the world nor the things of the world, <hi>viz.</hi> the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eye, and the pride of life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15, 16. to both theſe (that preceeding, and this ſucceeding the Text) doth the word <hi>I write unto you,</hi> and <hi>I have written to you</hi> refer. He obligeth all of them to theſe two things, becauſe their ſins were forgiven them, <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. and each of them by their particular priviledges; <hi>viz.</hi> the Fathers, becauſe they have known him that is from the beginning: the young men, becauſe they are ſtrong, and are Conquerours: the Children, becauſe they have known the Father: <hi>q. d.</hi> ſeeing theſe things are ſo, love one another as I ſaid before, and love not the world, which is that I now ſay.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let none meaſure himſelf by another, nor make compariſons either for lifting up or caſting down.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.6,—8.</note> Some of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43845:11"/>apt to be puffed up becauſe of their ſuppoſing themſelves to have attained more than others, which is an ill ſign; for though they were high in gifts and parts, they were low in grace, for they were but Babes; and therefore the Apoſtle pulls down their Plumes with this quick interrogation, Who makes thee (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou be) who makes thee to differ? And what haſt thou that thou didſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? Now, if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory (pride thy ſelf and boaſt) as if thou didſt not receive it? <hi>Grace gives us no leave to be proud, nor to deſpiſe undervalue others.</hi> And on the other hand there are ſome poor ſouls (and I believe there were ſuch among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as I ſhall clear by and by) that are apt to deſpond, when they compare and meaſure themſelves by others; when a Dwarf ſtands by a Gyant, a man of low ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by a tall one, as <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Goliah,</hi> he ſeems comparatively to be no body; but yet is (for kind) a man, a perfect man for all that, or notwithſtanding the great and vaſt difference that is between the one and the other. Many poor ſouls when they ſee how they are outſtript (in knowledge, faith, love and patience) by ſome that came into Chriſt long after themſelves, are apt to think that they are no Saints, becauſe they are not <hi>ſuch</hi> Saints; and this ſeems to be the caſe of ſome of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as I newly hinted, which will appear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There were ſome who were but as the foot (both in ſtate and ſenſe) the very loweſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43845:11"/>of the body, and were therefore too prone and inclinable to think that they were not of the body: for thus the Apoſtle ſpeaks to them, If the foot ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of the body? and if the car ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? No, no, you ſhould by no means ſay ſo, 'tis a meer <hi>non ſequitur.</hi> So if thou ſhouldſt ſay, becauſe I am not a Father, I am not a Child of God; it doth not follow, for thou maiſt be a Young-man; if not that, yet a little Child; if not that, yet a Babe in Chriſt; begin low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, do not ſtretch thy ſelf beyond thy meaſure. Nor let any be proud if they are gone beyond others, to be puffed up and deſpiſe the weak. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let every one be thankful and bleſs God for what he hath attained, be it more or leſs: Are any of you, Cedars in Lebanon, when others are but Shrubs, as the Hyſope on the wall, or as the lillies of the valley? are any of you (like <hi>Saul</hi>) taller than your Brethren by the head and ſhoulders? are you crowned with the gray-hairs of wiſdom and righteouſneſs? have ye overcome the wicked one? have ye lain in the Fathers boſom? <hi>give God the Glory, who gave you the Grace.</hi> Are others of you but of late admiſſion? or but of little and low ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? are ye but Babes in Chriſt? Yet deſpiſe not the day of ſmall things, let none of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or conſolations be ſmall to you, who are leſs than the leaſt of them all. <hi>'Tis great mercy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43845:12"/>to be one of Chriſts, though but one of his little ones.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus choſe twelve to be with him, as his family, whereof three were <hi>(è ſecretioribus)</hi> admitted to be his confidents, <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and of theſe three, <hi>John</hi> was the darling; he was the Diſciple whom Jeſus loved with a peculiar love, and was admitted to lie in his boſom: now if thou be not a <hi>John,</hi> yet thank him, if thou be a <hi>Peter</hi> or a <hi>James;</hi> if not of them, yet that thou art one of the twelve, but not <hi>Judas;</hi> if not one of the twelve to be with him, yet one of the ſeventy (for he afterward inlarged the number) to do him any ſervice abroad. Bleſs him that thou art a member of his body, though but an ear or a foot: that thou art a ſtarr in his firmament, though not of the firſt magnitude, but the very leaſt of all. <hi>David</hi> had his ſeveral Worthies, and the loweſt was honorable, though he attained not to the firſt three, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.23. and among the thirty ſeven, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riab</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> was the laſt, <hi>Verſe</hi> 39. Though thou be the laſt, yet 'tis mercy to be one of the thouſands of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Though thou do not ſit at the Kings table, yet bleſs him if thou be a Dore-keeper to behold his goings out and comings in. Bleſs him that thou art one of the little flock, though thou be not the Principal, or the choiſe, but the leaſt of it. If thou have learnt the A. B. C. of Godlineſs, the firſt principles and elements of the Doctrine of Chriſt, bleſs him for it; thou knoweſt not how ſoon he may teach thee to ſpell out, yea to read diſtinctly the more perfect leſſons,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43845:12"/>that thy joy may be full: he takes notice of the kindneſs of thy Child-hood, of thy liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and eſſays to ſpeak and go, and he will perhaps take thee by the hand and teach thee to go from form to form, till thou come to be one of the uppermoſt in the School of Chriſt, and then he will remove and tranſlate thee into the Univerſity (the holy Academy,) where the Spirits of juſt men made perfect will bid thee welcome and be glad of thy Company: then ſhalt thou be of the Society of true Chriſtians, of them that are in Chriſt indeed, and ſhalt live with Chriſt for ever, which is beſt of all. At preſent, if thou be not worth thouſands (rich in grace) yet bleſs him that thou art worth any thing, worthy of his calling, and made meet to partake of the inheritance of the Saints in light, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.12. by being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the power of darkneſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the Kingdom of his dear Son, <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. Though he have not made thee a Father, yet bleſs him that he hath made thee a Son, though as yet but a Babe and under age: <hi>he that bleſſeth God for a little, is in the ready way to be bleſt with more.</hi> Therefore again,</p>
               <p n="4">4.

No, but if theſe things be in you) and abound, then an abundant entrance ſhall be adminiſtred to you into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4,—11. Do not content your ſelf meerly with ſo much grace as will bring you into heaven (the haven of happineſs,) but that you may enter in with full ſails, with a plerophorie and full aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let not the weak envy (though they may emulate) the ſtrong, nor let the ſtrong deſpiſe the weak, but be helpers of their faith and joy. Poor Babes are apt to ſuffer
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43845:13"/>their eye to be evil, becauſe God is good, to grow ſullen, if others ſpeed better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but theſe things ought not to be ſo: for God may do with his own what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and give to every one as he will. Many of this form are like <hi>Davids</hi> Brother <hi>Eliab,</hi> who charged his inquiſitive boldneſs upon the pride of his heart, and conſidered not that 'twas of the Lord, who had choſen and preferr'd him before himſelf who was the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.28. with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6, 7. Which haply was <hi>(altâ mente repoſtum)</hi> the very reaſon of the grudge and picque againſt his Brother <hi>David. Saul</hi> alſo ey'd him with an evil eye, when his Victories increaſed, and the ten thouſands were attributed to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and but thouſands to himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.5,—9. Thus 'tis with weak Chriſtians, they are apt to envy their ſuperiors and betters the very grace of God: but let envyings as well as wrath be laid aſide, which the Apoſtles ſpeaks to Babes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. On the other hand, let not the ſtrong deſpiſe the weak, but bear with and bear their infirmities, which is to fulfil the Law of love and of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2, 3. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1,—7. this honour is due to theſe weaker Veſſels, for God hath beſtowed it upon them, he hath ſo tempered the body that the hand cannot ſay to the eye, I have no need of thee, nor again the head ('tis ſtrange, for the head is Chriſt; yet his Church is his fulneſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.23. much leſs can any of the members) ſay to the feet, I have no need of you, nay much more thoſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43845:14"/>members of the body, which ſeem to be moſt feeble, are (not only convenient, but) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. And not only we do, or ought to give, but God himſelf doth give more abundant honour to that part which lacketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.21,—24. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.2. The rich and poor meet together (in the ſame body) and the Lord is the maker of them all: he that made him poor, and thee rich, could have made him rich and thee poor: and as 'tis now, the rich need the poor as much as the poor need the rich; therefore deſpiſe not the poor and low. <hi>Job</hi> tells us that he deſpiſed not (nor durſt to deſpiſe) the cauſe of his Man-ſervant; no, nor of his Maid-ſervant; no, though they contended with him; for as he ſaith he could not Anſwer it to God, who made and faſhioned his Servant in the womb, as he did himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 31.13,—15. Excellent arguments!</p>
               <p>Well then, let not the Babe envy the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a great court many times there is a ſpecial favorite, but all the reſt are apt to envy him, though they alſo are in the ſame court, becauſe they are not favoured and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as he is: <hi>Every one would be the only one.</hi> So too often in the Court of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church, Jeſus Chriſt the King of Saints takes one or other (as <hi>John</hi>) to be his boſom favorite, and truely the other ambitious Courtiers cannot bear this, they look upon ſuch a perſon with an evil eye: as <hi>Peter</hi> did upon <hi>John,</hi> as you may read <hi>John</hi> 21. When Chriſt Jeſus had told <hi>Peter</hi> not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43845:14"/>only what he muſt do, but ſuffer alſo, (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to which he makes ſure of his love firſt, for one that loves not, or loves little, will not do or ſuffer much or willingly, yet after this being told of his ſufferings) and nothing of that nature ſaid concerning <hi>John,</hi> he ſeems to take it ill, and is not able to forbear asking the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and <hi>what ſhall this man do?</hi> which was a ſpice of envy, for Chriſt takes him up for't with an angty, <hi>what is that to thee?</hi> Joh. 21.15-22. When ſome poor ſouls, Babes that they are! ſee Children-Saints made ſo much of, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the light of Gods countenance, and lie in his boſom all the day long: and others Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-Saints making great conqueſts and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing victories over temptations; and when they hear Father-Saints tell long ſtories of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient acquaintance with Chriſt through every turn and diſpenſation, and what variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences they have had in all conditions; and withal, how little joy, victory, experience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they themſelves have, they are apt to envy and regret the others enjoyments and glory. So perhaps on the other ſide, when the Fathers hear the younger ones ſpeak of experiences, how they liſp and ſpeak but <hi>dimidiata verba,</hi> half words, and ſee how ſhort they fall of their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; when the Young-men ſee how the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are baffled and led into captivity by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; when the little Children ſee how igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Babes are, and that they know not their Father: at ſuch times the rich and ſtrong are apt to deride, or at leaſt to undervalue the poor and weak as unworthy of their company
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43845:15"/>and converſe. 'Tis but too common with them that know much to know it too much; and for them that are wiſe and rich, though but in their own eyes ſo many times, to have very low thoughts, and to ſpeak as meanly of their inferiours: but it ſhould not be ſo with Saints, if it be, 'tis their infirmity, not to give it a worſe name: let not therefore him that eateth ſtrong meat, deſpiſe him that eateth milk, nor let him that eateth but milk, envy him that eateth ſtrong meat; that I may allude ſomething to what the Apoſtle ſpeakes in another caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Seeing there are ſeveral degrees of Saints, let all be willing that each may have a ſhare and portion at a Sermon, or in an Epiſtle, as here in 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.13, 14. or at leaſt that ſome may be ſpoken to at one time and ſome at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for we cannot ſpeak to all at once. Some men muſt have patience at a Doal, for all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſerved at one time: ſo it is in this caſe. Some when they come to a Sermon, think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth the hearing, but what is ſpoken to their caſe; and truly almoſt ſo many minds as men: if it be not a diſcourſe for humbling, ſaith one; for conſolation, ſaith another; for exhortation, ſaith a third, 'tis nothing worth: Thus <hi>one is for Paul, another for Apollo, and a third for Cephas: ſome for Barnabas, and others for Boanerges:</hi> ſome for the Law, and others for free-grace: ſome for Faith, and others for Works. Fathers are for antiquities; Young-men for wars; Children for love-tokens; and Babes for milk: But, my beloved, all ſhould

               <p n="1">1. To Fathers, I entreat you, (for ſo I am commanded to do, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1.) I entreat you to lay aſide childiſh things, and let it not be ſaid of any of you, that you were once a man but twice a child. 'Tis not comely for aged perſons to play the child, or to play with children. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>When I was a Child,</hi> then indeed <hi>I ſpake as a Child, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as a Child, I thought as a Child: but when I became a man I put away childiſh things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.11.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43845:16"/>them (as <hi>David</hi> did his Children,) what God hath done for your ſoul. Tell them how God converted you, how God carried you on ſtep by ſtep, from Faith to Faith, and from one degree to another till you became Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I might add alſo, diſdain not to learn, for St. <hi>John</hi> writes to you Fathers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo concerning brotherly love, and not loving of the world, as if you had not perfectly learnt theſe things. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To Young-men I ſay, <hi>Be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus, and the Word that abideth in you;</hi> acquit your ſelves ſtill like the <hi>good Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to the young-man, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 3. <hi>And intangle not your ſelves with the affairs of this life</hi> (the love of the world) <hi>that you may pleaſe him who hath choſen you to be Souldiers,</hi> Ver. 4. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are for counſel, but you young-men for War; they ſit at ſtern, but you muſt fight; the glory of young-men is their ſtrength: be ſtrong then in Faith, for thence is your victory, by which you overcome the Devil and the World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5 4-5. <hi>and flee youthful luſts,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.22. <hi>For they war againſt your ſouls,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11.

               <p n="1">1. There is a vaſt difference between the leaſt or loweſt of Saints, and the higheſt of men, that are but meer men and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: between the worſt of Saints (<hi>viz.</hi> Babes) and the beſt of men, <hi>viz.</hi> P{hiloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, an d Moral men. <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> &amp;c. are great inſtances how far men may go by Natures help; and <hi>Paul</hi> (who was called <hi>Saul</hi>) before his converſion, how far a man may go by the help of the Law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. And yet the leaſt Saint, in the School of Chriſt, outgoes and ſurpiſſeth all theſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18.—31. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.—10. for he is taught of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. and though he be but a Babe, yet he is in Chriſt, and though as carnal, yet not a carnal man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. as all are that are not in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Gold though but in the Oare exceeds the beſt of clay and earth: ſo a Babe-Saint, which is but Gold in the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re, doth yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and excel all other m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, which are but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43845:18"/>clay and of the earth, earthly. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers tell us that the leaſt Fly hath more of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in it than the higheſt Heavens, becauſe 'tis a living thing, and moves from an internal principle of life, which they have not. And the wiſeſt of men, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us that a living Dog is better than a dead Lion: all which imports that life is the excellency of any being, and the more life the more excellency. Now men that are not converted are dead in ſins wherein they walk, as the Prodigal was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.32. and all were, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. And 'tis ſaid of the Gentiles again, that they were alienated from the life God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.18. But the leaſt, the Babe-Saint is quickened and made alive, for behold he breaths (Prayers) as 'twas ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> as ſoon as he was new-born, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. Theſe Babes have life, yea life more abundantly, for in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree they partake of a Divine nature and life.</p>
               <p>'Tis upon this account (among others and in the firſt place) that the righteous is better than his Neighbour, <hi>viz.</hi> that is not righteous, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26. The leaſt Saint is better than the beſt man in the Pariſh that is not a Saint. As our Saviour ſaid of <hi>John,</hi> That he was among them born of women one of the greateſt, yet that he who was leaſt in the Kingdom of God was greater than he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.11. ſo in an alluſive ſenſe I may ſay, that the leaſt and loweſt of Saints, born of God, is greater than the greateſt that is but born of a Woman. They that believe in Jeſus have this honor to be called
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43845:18"/>(and to be) the Sons of God, who are born not of Blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God; and ſurely they are moſt highly deſcended who are born from above, or of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12, 13. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us, that we ſhould be the firſt-fruits</hi> (i.e. the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent) <hi>of his creatures:</hi> For as manis greater than all the Creation of God (Angels except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4.—8.) ſo of all men, the Saints are the firſt-fruits, and in ſome reſpect advanced beyond the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. For the Angels are their attendants and ſervitours, yea they learn of the Church the manifold (or much varying) wiſdom of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10. and though Chriſt be head over them, yet he is not their head, as he is the head of the Church which is his Body, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22, 23. and 5.23. The beſt of men are but men at beſt, but grace makes men more men than they were, and more than men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there is a great difference between Saints and men, ſo there is diſparity between Saints and Saints; they (as the Stars) differ from one another in glory: All Saints are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, but they are not all alike excellent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. All of them do vertuouſly, but ſome excel the reſt. In the Body of man there are ſome members that are far more noble than others, there are principal and vital, and there are leſs principal and but accidental as to life, indeed all the members of Chriſts body are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and neceſſary, and yet ſome are more ſo than others; and as to their functions and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43845:19"/>do far excel the reſt: as the eye doth the ear, the hand the foot, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And the Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. That <hi>in a great houſe</hi> (ſuch is Gods Church) <hi>there are veſſels of Gold, and veſſels of Silver, and alſo of wood and earth, ſome to honour and ſome to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> which refers (not only to the difference that there is between common and ſpecial grace among men and Profeſſours, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. but) to the true members of the body, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.23. they are called leſs honourable: Now no man doubts but the veſſels of Silver and Gold are more excellent and honourable than them of earth and wood. There are ſome that are but wooden-Saints, and but earthen-Saints, in compariſon of ſome that are Silver and others that are golden-Saints: See and conſider 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12,—15. Yet this I ſay alſo, that the higheſt of Saints doth not ſo far exceed or excel the loweſt, as the loweſt exceeds and excels the higheſt of men; for the Saints compared one with another differ but (<hi>gradu</hi>) gradually, but Saints and men do differ (<hi>ſpecie</hi>) in kind: Gold in the Oare is not ſo much inferiour to the moſt refined and pure Gold, as clay and earth is inferiour to Gold in the Oare; that difference is but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, but this is ſpecifical.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is ſomething common to all the Saints of what degree ſoever they be, <hi>viz.</hi> they are all born of God, all his Children, all taught of God from the greateſt to the leaſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.11. with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20,—27. which he ſpeaks of the (<gap reason="foreign">

Truth of Grace is common to all, though growth of Grace be (in ſome reſpects) more peculiar to ſome. They are all brethren, and are brought forth in the Image of God, and created according to him (or his likeneſs) in righteouſneſs and holineſs of truth: You may eſpie—the Fathers Image in the Babe his eye. Though they be but newly born, yet they are new-born and new creatures. In ſhort and fine, they are all members of the Body, the foot as well as the hand, the ear as well as the eye, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Though the Stars differ from one another in glory, yet they agree in this, that they are all of them Stars. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Young-men, the little Children, and the Babes alſo have this in common, that they are of Gods Family, and of the houſhold of Faith, the ſons of God; they are all in Chriſts School, though not all of one Form.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As there is ſomething common to all, ſo there are ſome things proper and peculiar to each ſtate; ſomething proper to the Fathers, which cannot be ſaid of the young-men; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proper to the young-men, which cannot be ſaid of the little Children; ſomething pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the little Children, which cannot be ſaid
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43845:20"/>of the Babes; as there is ſomething proper to the Babes which cannot be ſaid of them that are not yet new-born; though there be too much in common with Babes and carnal men, they being not yet throughly cleanſed from their blood and pollution, but are <hi>as</hi> carnal, and walk as men. There is ſomething in the beſt Saints that may be found in every one, but there is that in ſome that cannot be found in all. The Apoſtle gives theſe three Claſſes pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar attributes; That of Fathers is Wiſdom, that of young men is Valour, that of little Children is Love; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that the Babes eat but milk, <hi>i. e.</hi> they repent and believe (a little faintly) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which St. <hi>Peter</hi> adds deſires, as was noted before from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. 'Tis true indeed the higheſt and greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the leſs, but not the leſs the greater, much leſs the greateſt. The Father knows all the four ſtates, for he hath paſt from a Babe to a little Child, from a little Child to a young man, and from thence to a Father. The young man knows three ſtates, for he paſt from a Babe to a little Child, and from thence to a young man; the little Child knows but two ſtates, being gone no further than from a Babe to a little Child; but the Babe is acquainted with only his own ſtate (at preſent) and knows not what 'tis to be any thing of what is proper to the other three; only this, he is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſpecial grace: No, nor only in acceſſaries and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental, but in principal and fundamental graces, proper to each ſtate. 'Tis not in their gifts but graces, for 'tis poſſible for perſons to be full of and rich in gifts, yet poor in grace, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, they came behind in no gift, 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. they were full, they were rich, they reigned as Kings; they were wiſe, ſtrong, and honourable (at leaſt in their own if not others eſteem) 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, and 10. and yet were but Babes and as carnal, 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.1. And therefore the Apoſtle ſhews them a more excellent way than that of gifts, <hi>viz.</hi> grace, and in ſpecial the grace of Love, 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 12.31. and 13.1,—3. <hi>Apollo</hi> was a man very eloquent, mighty in the Scriptures, and being inſtructed in the way of the Lord, was fervent in Spirit, and taught zealouſly, diligently and boldly, yet needed to have the way of God expounded to him more perfectly, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.24,—26. And this was done not only by a man, <hi>Aquila,</hi> but a woman <hi>Priſcilla; Apollo</hi> was a man in parts, but a woman (it ſeems) was more a man in grace. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> that came behind in no gift, yet came behind in and fell ſhort of many a grace. So that the meaſure of a mans excellency is not to be taken by what gifts of knowledge and eloquence he hath, but by what grace he acts.</p>
               <p>Again, this meaſure is not to be taken from common, but from ſpecial and ſaving grace;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43845:21"/>not from profeſſion but practice. There is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith, and the Faith of Gods Elect; there were fooliſh as well as wiſe Virgins; are ſeeming as well as truly religious perſons; the ſtony ground hearers made a fair ſhew in the fleſh; and the thorny brought forth fruit, but not to perfection: Which is an argument that they knew not the root of the matter, or the grace of God in truth, for that brings forth ripe fruit, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. There were ſome that through the knowledge of Chriſt had eſcaped the pollutions of the world, yet licked up their vomit (and therefore their nature was not changed, but they were Dogs ſtill) and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed again in the mire, and therefore though they were waſhed, yet were Sows ſtill, and not really converted ſo as to have a ſaving work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20,—22. <hi>Surely,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they that went out from us, were not of us</hi> (but a baſtardly brood) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. where he ſpeaks of <hi>them</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>[us]</hi> which word <hi>[us]</hi> he mentions five times by way of diſtinction, and the word [<hi>they</hi>] ſix times in that one Verſe.</p>
               <p>Yet again, the meaſure is not to be taken from acceſſary graces, which conduce chiefly to the well-being, the comfort and refreſhment (or if I may ſo ſpeak) the recreation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as Joy, Ecſtaſie, Rapture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but from the graces which are eſſential and proper to each ſtate; as wiſdom and much experience is for Fathers; ſtrength and the Word abiding for young men; Love for Children; and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Babes. Now as any perſon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43845:21"/>doth act the ſubſtantial and fundamental graces of any ſtate, ſuch is his denomination; and as he paſſeth from one to another, ſuch is his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and preferment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As this difference is to be meaſured by graces wrought and acted, ſo 'tis made by the grace of God working and actuating theſe graces in us. 'Tis grace that makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence not only between Saints and ſinners, but between Saints and Saints: that it makes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men and men in taking one and making him a Saint, and leaving the other in his ſins, is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13,—16. and <hi>ver.</hi> 21,—24. with many other places. And 'tis as clear that grace and the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God makes the difference between Saints alſo, that the one hath more grace and improveth grace more than another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. and 12.11,—18. Indeed, God worketh all things according to (no counſel but) the counſel of his Will, and who ſhall ſay to him, Why haſt thou made me thus? His wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as where, ſo how, it liſteth; and as he ſheweth mercy to whom he pleaſeth, ſo 'tis what and how much he pleaſeth; the firſt and the after increaſe is of God: he gives five Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to one, two to another, and but one to a third; and 'tis not the man but the Talent that brings in the gain, as the Apoſtle, when he had ſaid, <hi>I live,</hi> corrects himſelf with a <hi>not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and my life is by Faith,</hi> Gal. 2.20. And when he had ſaid, <hi>He laboured more abundantly than they all,</hi> he ſeems to recall it, and ſaith, <hi>Not I but the grace of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43845:22"/>God which was beſtowed upon me, and was with me,</hi> viz. to aſſiſt and enable me, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.16. And 'tis obſervable how <hi>Paul</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters his language, when he ſpeaks of what he did in a ſtate of nature, and what he did in a ſtate of grace: then he attributes all to himſelf, I <hi>was</hi> this, and I <hi>did</hi> this, (he was alwaies a great proficient) <hi>I profited more in the Jews religion, than many of my contemporaries that were of my ſtanding,</hi> Gal. 1.14. But when he is converted, though he laboured more than any, and outwent his Seniors, yet he is not arrogant and aſſuming, but modeſt and thankful, <hi>Not I, but the grace of God that was with me,</hi> q. d. Though by nature I was forward and zealous, yet as to this work and labour, I have reaſon to attribute it and pay my gratitudes not to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but to grace.</p>
               <p>Well then, as 'tis of grace that one is taken and another left, ſo 'tis of grace that one is promoted and advanced more than another; that <hi>John</hi> lyeth in his boſome; that <hi>Paul</hi> grows ſo faſt; that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth with the increaſe of God, is of God, and of the grace of God; that one ſhould be a Father, and another, who is may be, was in Chriſt before him, ſhould be but a Babe ſtill, is of grace. One would think wiſe men ſhould know moſt, yet by grace Babes are wiſer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. That ſtrong men ſhould do moſt, and yet the weak do more, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25,—31. That the Children of the Kingdom ſhould not enter, but Publicans and Harlots ſhould, is a difference of graces making. And when in the Body, that this ſhould be an Eye, that an Ear, this an
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43845:22"/>Hand, that but a Foot, is becauſe God hath ſet the members in the Body, every one as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. That this is a Babe and but a Babe (and ſo of the reſt) 'tis even ſo Father for it ſeemeth good in thy ſight, 'tis thy Will and pleaſure it ſhould be ſo. And yet beſide this,</p>
               <p n="7">7. God hath great and glorious ends in having people of ſeveral ſizes and degrees in his Church, ſeveral members in the Body, and ſeveral Claſſes and Forms in the School of Chriſt. Though God be not bound to give an account of any of his matters, yet he is pleaſed to be ſo condeſcending as to vouchſafe to do it. As every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon, ſo in its place. When God was about to erect the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial temple, he made men and things fit on purpoſe; there were Stones and Timber as well as Gold, and Veſſels of ſeveral ſorts and ſizes; ſome men wrought in Gold, ſome in purple and blew; ſome had one office and employment and ſome another. So when he erected a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.5.</note> houſe and building (his Church, the Body of Chriſt) he did, and continueth to do the like, but far more gloriouſly, that as then ſo now, every one may ſpeak of his glory, or (as 'tis in the Margent) every whit may ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory, <hi>viz.</hi> to him, to whom 'tis due, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.9. To this the Apoſtle alludes, when he ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.21. <hi>In whom,</hi> i.e. in Chriſt Jeſus the whole building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy Temple in the Lord. So <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. <hi>From the Head,</hi> viz. Chriſt, all the Body by joynts and bands having nouriſhment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43845:23"/>miniſtred, and knit together, increaſeth with the increaſe of God. And more fully, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. <hi>From whom</hi> (the head—Chriſt) the whole body fitly joyned together and compacted, by that which <hi>every joynt</hi> ſupplieth, according to the effectual working in the meaſure of <hi>every part,</hi> maketh increaſe of the Body to the ediſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſelf in Love. By all which we ſee with what curioſity and exactneſs of Art (may I ſo ſpeak) God hath ordered every part in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the beauty and perfection of the whole: Here is Beauty, Harmony, Communion, Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſication, all met together.</p>
               <p>The more pieces there are in any work drawn into an union, the more admirable is that work. When the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaw the Houſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> had built, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there was no more ſpirit in her, ſhe was rapt with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.4, 5. Much more is it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of tranſport to ſee the variety and unity of the Houſe of God! This made the firſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God ſo glorious, that he brought together and united ſo many Atoms of duſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body of a man; to frame ſuch a curious piece out of duſt, was worthy of a behold and wonder. And 'tis no leſs a beauty that's drawn by God himſelf, but a far greater in the ſecond Creation; eſpecially as to the whole Body-my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.20.</note> made up of ſuch different Members, as Fathers, Young men, little Children, and Babes, all united to ſo glorious an Head, as Chriſt is, and called his fulneſs. That in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick ſo many ſeveral ſounds ſhould melt into one; and in Painting ſo many lines and colours
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43845:23"/>ſhould conſpire to make one Face, is admired even by Artiſts; but alas! what's Art to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? and what's Nature to Grace? What Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ever like to the Body of Chriſt, ſo fitly framed together? But,</p>
               <p>In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. the Apoſtle gives us a more particular account of Gods deſign herein and tells us that there is not one unneceſſary mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, no not the moſt feeble, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.22. And if theſe have ſuch abundant honour beſtowed upon them, what is the honor of the comely parts that have <hi>no need?</hi> Verſ. 23. <hi>No need?</hi> what though they need not what the other parts do, yet have they no need of one another? Yes ſurely, for God hath ſo tempered the Body, and hath ſo ſet the Members, <hi>That the Eye cannot ſay to the Hand, I have no need of thee:</hi> Nor the Head to the Feet (Oh ſtange!) I have no need of you, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. There is as much need of the Foot as the Hand, of the Ear as the Eye, and of the Smelling as of Seeing and Hearing, (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 15, 16, 17.) to make the Body complear, for if there were but one ſort of members, it were no body, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. But what's the end of all this variety and diſparity? 'tis <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25, 26. that there ſhould be no ſchiſm or diviſion in the body; but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one of another (as if it were for themſelves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. as if the caſe were your own, for ſo it may be) and that if one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſuffer, all the members may ſuffer with it, or one member be honoured, all the reſt may rejoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with it. There is ſuch a mutual aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance reſulting from this united variety, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43845:24"/>'tis far better not only for the whole, but for each one, than if they were every one for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as the world is) and were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for none elſe. Wo to him that is alone without the Society and Sympathy of others; but what an hapiſying communion do the Babes deſires, the little Childrens love, the Young mens ſtrength, and the Fathers wiſdom, I ſay what an happiſying communion do theſe make in relation to one another! And that theſe may the better contribute to each other, God embodies them, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. it there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>What alas! ſhould the weak do, were there not ſome ſtronger to bear their infirmities? <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1. What ſhould an overtaken one do, if there were not ſome ſpiritual ones to reſtore him, and ſet him in joynt again with (a Ladies hand, yea with) a ſpirit of meekneſs? <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. And this they are obliged to do as if they were in their ſtead and condition, conſidering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that eitheir they have been, or may be tempted, and therefore ſhould bear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burden. Yea, I may add alſo what would the elder ſort do with all their ſtrength and knowledge, if there were not others to be ſtrengthned and taught by them, for <hi>ſcire tuum nihil eſt niſi te ſcire hoe ſciat alter,</hi> the good of knowledge and experience is not only in being peſſeſt of it, but in communicating it: the deſign of ſuch mens having more grace than others is not only for their own ſalvation (leſs would do that) but for others edification alſo, as giſts ſo great degrees of grace are given <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:43845:24"/>for a common good. As <hi>Paul</hi> was converted not meerly to ſave him, but that he might be an example to them that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve hereafter, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. So in his tribulations and temptations he was comforted, not only for his own ſupport, but for the conſolation and ſalvation of others, that he might be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith he was comforted of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3, — 6. in which exerciſe he was not a little converſant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 29.</p>
               <p>Thus then you ſee that this body is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact that the communion between the members is lively, ſympathizing and aſſiſtant, as if it were every ones own caſe. This indeed is the excellency of this great piece of Gods work, that all the members are ſo joynted, that if you touch one all the reſt feel it, and have a ſenſe of it, as the Head alſo hath if any of his members be abuſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.4.5. There are many carved and other painted pieces that pleaſe the Eye to look upon them, but have no life nor ſenſe, if you touch one part, the reſt are not concerned; but in this body, they rejoyce together and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer together according to the good or evil any members meet withal. If but a Toe be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on, the Head feels it, and cries out, <hi>Saul, Saul why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> If <hi>Peter</hi> be in Priſon, the Church is at Prayers: the members of this body are partners in joy and ſorrow; if they laugh, 'tis together; if they weep, 'tis together, like twins in one. As each member contributes to the making up and edification of the whole, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16. So each partakers of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43845:25"/>the enjoyments or ſufferings of the whole or any part. And to this purpoſe God hath framed (thus harmoniouſly and admirably) this body, made up of theſe members, Babes, little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Young men and Fathers, all of whom are neceſſary and aſſiſtant to the edification and perfection of the whole Structure.</p>

               <p>The reaſon of this in general is from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing grace of God, who cauſes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſome to be more expeditious than others: all increaſe and fruit is from him; but ſome he bleſſeth more abundantly, waters them every moment, pours out much of his Spirit upon them at the very beginning, more than

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43845:29"/>that meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt to which they are appointed. The Babe that is to be a Child by appointment, ſhall be ſo by attainment, and ſo of the reſt. No Saint ſhall die till he have attained the utmoſt of what he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to. As none of Gods Elect (I ſpeak <hi>de adultis</hi> of them come to years) die before they are converted, ſo no converted ones die till they come to their maturity and be ripe (like a ſhock of Corn) for the Garner of God. <hi>God gathers none but ripe fruit,</hi> though ſome be riper ſooner than other, and as I may ſay, ſome be Summer and others Winter fruit, ſome die young and others old, yet there ſhall not be an Infant of daies, nor an old man that hath not fulfilled his years, but every one ſhall attain to his full ſtature, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.20.

                  <hi>David</hi> was a man of a publick ſpirit, and ſerved his Generation according to the Will of God; and what then? why then he fell aſleep; when his work was done he went to bed, to reſt in the boſom of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36. though his body ſaw corruption, which Chriſts Body (who was without ſin) did not ſee. Indeed <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43845:29"/>thought to have done more work (<hi>viz.</hi> to build the Temple) but that was reſerved for another, and therefore having done his devoir, he fell aſleep.

So the reverend good old man <hi>(Simeon)</hi> could not die till he had ſeen (and could not but die when he had ſeen) the Salvation of God, This then is the thing in hand, that God (having begun a good work) will finiſh it before he take any of his converted ones out of this world: he will bring them to their appointed ſtature: it may be ſome may die in the good old age of Fathers; others while Young men in their prime, their marrow in their bones, after great and glorious atchievements and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories; others in their Child-hood, while their love is fervent and ſtrong; and others in their Babe-ſtate with the milk in their mouth: but every one (before the time of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture come) ſhall finiſh that work which was appointed for him to do.</p>

'Tis neceſſary (to avoid ſcruples and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections) that I premiſe this alſo; theſe ſtates are not ſo conſtantly fixed and immutable, but that ſometimes for a ſeaſon there may be a variation: A Babe may have a Spring-tide now and then, but he ebbs again quickly, and comes to low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water mark again.

               <p>The Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> her love and works were more at firſt, than when our Saviour ſent her that Epiſtle; and the Church of <hi>Thyatica</hi> her works more at laſt than at firſt; yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude from the partial decay of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or advance of the latter, which was beſt at laſt, for that might repent, and this not hold faſt, which were the duties called for; that from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and this from <hi>Thyatira;</hi> but this we may clearly ſee, that great beginnings of zeal may be intermitted and decay; and on the other hand that ſmall beginnings may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to more and more godlineſs. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons run without wearineſs, and walk without faintneſs, grow without intermiſſion, they meet with no rubs nor lets, they are not nipt in the bud, and put back by an hard ſeaſon, as ſome

There is a great variety in theſe things, the firſt laſt, and the laſt firſt very often; the younger born is the elder grown in grace.

                  </gap>) which in <hi>John</hi> is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred little Children, is once uſed by <hi>Paul</hi> to denote want or weakneſs of underſtanding,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43845:34"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. My Brethren, be not Children in underſtanding; that therefore it cannot be meant in that place of theſe little Children which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of is clear as the Sun, for this is the excellency which <hi>John</hi> attributes to them, <hi>that they know the Father,</hi> they are called little Children from knowledge, which notes an underſtanding that amounts to aſſurance; but Babes (conſidered in nature or in grace) know not their Father: ſo that from this very character 'tis apparent that the ſtate or rank of Babes is below that of little Children, theſe are Sons and know it, but Babes (though they be, yet) know not, <hi>i. e.</hi> have not the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that they are ſo: though they have the things that do aſſure, yet they have not (for want of light) either the aſſurance of the things, or aſſurance by them: but are in this ſenſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, not reprobates (as we read it) but without proof, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Babes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. They ſought a proof of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Apoſtleſhip, and he requires a proof of their Converſion, but they were leſs able to prove this, than he was able to prove that, as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. He was not (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) but they were (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) without proof. So that though they had grace, yet it was ſo weak in its actings &amp; operations that it afforded them no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, as ſtrong and vigorous grace uſeth to do.</p>
               <p>The Star-light of their grace is not clear enough in Babes to diſcern their converſation by it, and many times 'tis clouded too, that the Stars do not appear: and though grace live in their hearts, yet the light and comfort of it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43845:34"/>may be wanting; for though every man having the power of reflecting upon his own actions, can diſcern what thoughts are in him and what affections, and can tell what he loves, what he fears and grieves for, and the like; yet he may ſtill be queſtioning and doubting whether this his love, ſear, grief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be gracious, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and truly holy actings or not: whereof the reaſon is this, becauſe though the Spirit which is in a man knows the things of a man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. Yet what is the true worth of theſe things which are in him, and whether given him of God, and wrought in him by God unto Salvation, this we cannot know but by a ſupervening light of the Spirit, who is not only the worker of Grace in us, but is given us to diſcover and enlighten it to us, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. Now without this light or Teſtimony of the Spirit (which the little Children have, but Babes have not) 'tis with them as with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, who knows not the things of the Spirit, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. Whereas the ſpiritual man judgeth all things wrought in him by the Spirit by the light thereof: Now Babes not being ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual (but as carnal) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle could not write of ſuch things as he did to the ſpiritual, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.13. but was ſain to ſeed them with milk (like Babes as they were) for they were not able (as the ſpiritual were) to bear meat, <hi>viz.</hi> ſtrong meat, having weak ſtomachs, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.2. They like the <hi>Hebrews</hi> could hear of and believe in Chriſt, in ſome kind, but to take him as Chriſt crucified, as the great high Prieſt, as their righteouſneſs,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43845:35"/>they were yet in great part to learn and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt; which was the caſe both of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Babes, as will appear more anon by comparing 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.10, 11. &amp;c. for then by theſe diſtinct attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and characters 'tis (as I hope) made plain that there is a Claſſis and Form of Babes in Chriſt, who are a degree below the little Children: and of this ſtate of Babes I ſhall treat firſt, becauſe they are the beginning of the new Creation of God; and I am apt to believe that the Kingdom of God and of Chriſt, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth, is made up and filled up more of theſe than of any other ſort, not to ſay than of all the other ſorts: that is to ſay, that there are more Babes in Chriſt, than there are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Young men or Fathers: to which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure that ſaying of our Saviour may bear a Teſtimony, in a fuller ſenſe than 'tis common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, though I doubt not but the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Let us in the next place ſee how pat and parallel to this, that other Text in the fifth of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is. The Authour having told them, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. That Chriſt Jeſus being made perfect, <hi>i. e.</hi> glorified, was become the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour or meritorious and procuring cauſe of Salvation to them that (believe in and) obey him, called of God an High Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedee,</hi> Verſ. 10. <hi>Of whom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>we have many things to ſay:</hi> why do ye not ſay on and ſpeak out then? Why, becauſe they are hard to be uttered, which doth not imply any defect or inability in the Apoſtle to utter them, as if he wanted either know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or utterance, but an incapacity in them to entertain them, becauſe they were dull of hearing; for though as to their ſtanding they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43845:36"/>might have been teachers, yet as to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they needed to learn, and con over again the firſt principles, and lay the firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They had need of Milk (as the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> had) <hi>i. e.</hi> to be taught to repent and believe as if they were ſcarce converted, but as carnal. Thus both theſe places concur in the ſame ſubjects and attributes. Before I come to ſpeak of their attainments and characters par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, I ſhall briefly touch a few obſervations from theſe two Texts, which will make our way the more plain and ſmooth. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are ſome Chriſtians or perſons in Chriſt which are not men in Chriſt, but only Babes: They have the Spirit of Chriſt (in a meaſure) or elſe they could not be his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. Yet though they have the Spirit, they are nt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſpiritual (in any high degree). Though in Chriſt Jeſus, (for elſe they were not new-born, or new creatures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.) yet they are but Babes in Chriſt, and <hi>as</hi> (the very next degree to) carnal: they cry rather than ſpeak, their voice is inarticulate and not diſtinct, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. They have the Image of God upon them, but not perfectly ſtampt and viſible to every eye: 'Tis but (as I may ſay) God manifeſt in the Fleſh, under a veil and darkly; Chriſt is not (perfectly) formed in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. You may ſee ſome Prints and ſimilitudes, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral features are not clearly diſcernable. They are tranſlated from death to life, they are no Abortives; nor are they ſtill-born: they have the beginning of life, and they do but begin to live. There is joy in Heaven that this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43845:37"/>is born, though he be not yet grown up, no nor throughly waſhed and cleanſed from his pollution. He is yet but in ſwadling cloaths and in a Manger, if I may allude to what was ſaid of Chriſt, when he was a Babe. As the life, ſo the image is imperfect; you can ſay there's the Image of a man, but who 'tis like (whether like its Father) you can hardly tell; yet this you can ſay 'tis not the Devils or the Sinners image; and God knows that 'tis his Image: and Chriſt knows it to be the Fathers Image, for 'tis born not of the Fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of the Will of God. They ſhould not have the name of Babes, if they had not the Fathers Image, though it be not ſo legible to ſtanders by, as that of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man is. The Babe is a Chriſtian in the ſmalleſt Print, but the ſpiritual man is one in Capital and Golden Letters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some perſons may be but Babes for a long time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. Yea, though they live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the beſt Preaching in the world: as ſome were under Chriſt his own Miniſtery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. The Diſciples (many of them) were no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till Chriſt aſcended, and the Spirit deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> had heard three of the beſt Preachers on Earth; <hi>Paul, Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.12. and <hi>chap.</hi> 3.4,—6. yet were but Babes. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> had ſate under the like Miniſtry, and yet were but Babes for many years. <hi>Paul</hi> it ſeems had begotten (or planted) the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he was their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14, 15. <hi>Apollo</hi> was their nurſing Fathers, he had watered them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43845:37"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> continued among them a year and an half teaching the Word of God among them, as <hi>Acts</hi> 18.1,—11. you have the whole ſtory. After <hi>Pauls</hi> departure <hi>Apollo</hi> came to <hi>Corinth</hi> (and watered them, whom <hi>Paul</hi> had planted) <hi>Acts</hi> 18.27. with 19.1. yet from that time to the day of the date of this Epiſtle, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Babes. <hi>Philip,</hi> who (it ſeems) was called by Chriſt Jeſus in the firſt year of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and in the beginning of that year, for he was called before the firſt Miracle that Chriſt wrought at the Wedding in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> which was the firſt he did to confirm his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial effice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.43. with 2.11. Yet this <hi>Philip</hi> who had lived with Chriſt all the time of his Miniſtry, was yet, when Chriſt was about to leave the world, but a Babe, for he knew not the Father (as the little Children do) which made Chriſt ſpeak upbraidingly to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Have I been ſo long time with you, and yet haſt thou not known me, Philip? He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father, and how ſaiſt thou then, ſhew us the Father?</hi> Alas! of how many Hearers, may many a Preacher ſay, have I been ſo long with you, and yet ye know not the Father!

When Chriſt Jeſus was telling his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples the offices of the Spirit, he makes a ſtop and tells them, I have yet many things (more) to ſay unto you, but you cannot bear them yet (which is the character of theſe Babes <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.12. <hi>q. d.</hi> I could tell you what great things there are in mine and my Fathers heart and purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you, but you are not in a condition to receive them, till you have received the Spirit, and grown up to another (higher) ſtate than yet you are in. Babes cannot bear the Mathematical and Metaphyſical demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they cannot underſtand them, but they are for ſimilitudes, illuſtrations and Parables, and ſo Chriſt taught them, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.33.

The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> underſtood but little of the Prieſt-hood of Chriſt and his Office, which is the ſtrong meat, no though the Apoſtle illuſtrated it by their own (ſhadowy) Prieſt-hood, which they had under the Law. So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of the ſtate of renovation (the new Heavens, and the new Earth) of which his beloved brother <hi>Paul</hi> had alſo written in his Epiſtles; of which (not Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for there is a change of the gender, and 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">Prov. 14.6.</note> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13,—17. But they cannot eat ſtrong meat, yet they can eat milk; though but milk, yet milk; which implies that they were not only alive, but had ſome (a very little) ſtrength, and took in ſome nouriſhment, and had ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the working of grace in them, though 'twere weak and faint. Saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>I have fed you with milk,</hi> which notes that he did not only give it them, but that though they did not thrive much, yet it kept life and Soul together (as we uſe to ſay) it kept them alive in their preſent ſtate, which was low and weak. What this milk is, I am to ſhew anon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe Babes are owned for Brethren as well as the ſpiritual ones, by the Apoſtle; though they had not the right yet they had the left-hand of fellowſhip. And I <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>though you be but weak, yet you and I are Brethren:</hi> the ſpiritual <hi>Paul,</hi> and (<hi>as</hi> carnal) <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> Babes were Brethren: yea not only <hi>Paul,</hi> but Chriſt himſelf (the firſt born among the many Brethren) is not aſhamed to call the Babes, as well as others, Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. which takes in all the Children, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13.14. For Chriſt took the whole ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Verſ.</hi> 16.

The whole
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43845:39"/>brother-hood have fellowſhip one with another, as all the members of the body have from head to foot.</p>
               <p>This then is the ſumm of all that we have ſaid; that theſe Babes have truth of Grace, the root of the matter is in them, God hath put truth in their inward parts, and written the truth of Repentance, Faith and Love in their hearts: They are true born, and not Baſtards, as the diſtinction is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 'Tis true alſo that their grace is weak; 'tis grace and but grace in a low degree; beſide alſo 'tis mix'd with much corruption (ſtrong corruptions are arguments of weak grace) they are <hi>as</hi> carnal: of all Saints the Babe-Saint hath the leaſt grace and the moſt corruption. And (which is to be noted of all the reſt alſo) theſe Babes have not their denomination, nor are ſo called meerly from their being but newly born, but from their continuance in ſuch a ſtate. No ſtate is meaſured by one or two acts, but from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, frame and courſe of their hearts and lives for ſuch a time and duration.

                  <p>MIlk we ſee is the Food of Babes: and therefore 'tis neceſſary that we come to know what this Milk is, for the better, diſcovery of their ſtate and attainment. In the general, all the Word of God (the Goſpel) is called Milk, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new-born Babes deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby;</hi> This Milk is for growth; the word is not only for begetting, as <hi>chap.</hi> 1.23. and 25. but 'tis for nouriſhing and bringing up alſo, even to a perfect ſtature, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11,—16. 'Tis obſervable, that <hi>Peter</hi> doth not ſpeak meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Word written in the Bible, but of the Word Preach'd, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.25. But then this Word Preach'd muſt be <hi>ſincere milk of the Word,</hi> not mixt and corrupted with and by the devices, inventions, gloſſes and comments of Jews or Gentiles; this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diſclaims and declaims againſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>We are not as many, who corrupt, or deal deceitfully with the Word of God; but as of ſincerity, but as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt,</hi> which he alſo hath again, <hi>chap</hi> 4.2. <hi>We have renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty</hi> (or ſhame) <hi>not walking in craftineſs, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifeſtation of the truth, commending our ſelves to every mans conſcience in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43845:40"/>the ſight of God.</hi> We are no huckſters like them mentioned, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1,—3. As this word muſt not be mixed with and corrupted by falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and baſe ends, ſo this milk muſt not be made luſcious and fulſome with the Sugar and Honey of mens wiſdom and eloquence, for this doth the Apoſtle no leſs diſown and diſallow, as may be ſeen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. My ſpeech and my Preaching was not with inticing words of mans wiſdom (I was not as <hi>ſounding braſs or a tinkling cymbal,</hi> I did not uſe feigned and made words to ſhew wit and learning; I came not with that wiſdom which lies in words, with witticiſms, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.17.) but in demonſtration of the Spirit and power. So then 'tis not a ſound of words, but ſound and ſincere doctrine or Milk of the Word by which we grow and thrive.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly (as to our Subject) milk is uſed to denote weak nouriſhment, and is oppoſed to ſtrong meat; and thus Milk notes the firſt principles of the Oracles of God, the Alphabet of Chriſtian Religion, of this the Babes have their mouth and belly full, but are weak and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That Milk therefore, in theſe Texts, is put for the principles (the firſt Elements of the Doctrine of Chriſt) or as 'tis in the Margent, the word of the beginning of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. with 6.1. The very foundation of Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is, that the Kingdom of God (the Meſſiah d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43845:40"/>the initiating Doctrine, wherein (ſaith <hi>Jac.

                  </p>
                  <p>But (it may be) ſome will object, here is no mention of Faith in Chriſt, and can they be Chriſtians in any degree (though but Babes) who believe not in Chriſt?

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d or Doctrine of the beginning of Chriſt, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. and therefore this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith is not without reſpect to Chriſt; and when the Apoſtle mentions theſe two elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, he ſpeaks of Chriſt as the object of Faith, teſtifying both to the Jews and to the Greeks, Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. and this the Apoſtle taught the <hi>Corinthians</hi> at firſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.2, 3. which opens the meaning of that ſpeech of his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. Beſide, in calling this foundation Doctrine, Chriſt muſt needs be taken in, for other foundation can no man lay, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. becauſe God hath laid him and no other, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.11, 12. and 'tis by him that we believe in God, as the Apoſtle hath it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Withall we muſt remember that theſe were but Babes, and were unskilfull in the word of righteouſneſs, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome confuſed notions of it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed both God and Chriſt are the objects of Faith; and though God be the ultimate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, for Chriſts deſign is to bring us
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43845:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. Yet Chriſt is the more immediate object of it; but nature teaching us to look to God, and revelation of grace only to look to Chriſt, many perſons (eſpecially Babes) are apt to have more recourſe to God than to Chriſt: For the Faith of Babes is of no higher an elevation, than theirs generally was under the Old Teſtament, who had not ſuch diſtinct notions of Chriſt Jeſus as we under the Goſpel have or ought to have, he being now manifeſted to manage all affairs for us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and us; and therefore our Saviour bids his Diſciples not only to believe in God, but in him alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly all along afterward, the Apoſtles in their Preaching, direct men to believe in Chriſt Jeſus; and this is the excellency of knowing (or the excellent knowledge of) Chriſt Jeſus, to know him ſo as to be found in him, not having our own righteouſneſs which is of the Law (which Babes too much look after) but that which is by Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.9. And this is that which the Apoſtle directs the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and 3.10, 11. And ſo the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in ſetting him forth to them as an High Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> the King of righteouſneſs, and the Lord ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Hence then I conclude, that their eating of Milk is the receiving and practiſing theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or Elements, the beginning of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance, Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in the general takes in ſuch things as theſe, a ſight and ſenſe of ſin, together with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43845:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſorrow for and Repentance from it, as alſo Prayer for pardon: a ſecret relying on the mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus, which gives them hope: An obedience to Ordinances, as Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A believing of the Reſurrection, and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgement. But there are ſealings of the Spirit, joyes in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Babes are not acquainted with: they attain to what is neceſſary, and but what is neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. They have enough to keep them out of Hell, and to land them ſafe in Heaven; but as to the well-being of a Saint, <hi>viz.</hi> an aſſurance of the Fathers Love, which the little Children have; ſtrength of Faith to overcome temptations, which the young men have; great wiſdom from long or much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which the Fathers have: of theſe they know nothing. They are Gods building in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. but only of the firſt Floor, or ſtory, juſt laid upon the foundation, yet ſo that they alſo are the Temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth but almoſt indiſcernably in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. they will, I ſay, have an entrance into Heaven, becauſe theſe things are in them, but not an abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance becauſe theſe things do not abound in them, as <hi>Peter</hi> intimates, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8,—11. and all this is ſpoken of a ſtate wherein they may live and die and not reach beyond it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Before I proceed 'tis neceſſary to clear up one ſcruple that may ariſe from hence, which is this: Seeing growth of grace is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prove the truth of grace, how can theſe be ſaid to grow, if they may continue in this ſtate all their daies?</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:43845:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You may remember how I premiſed that none can tell but he may be built up a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (or more) higher, and therefore none ſhould take up with this ſtint, but preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; yet ſeeing there is ſuch a ſtate (which is to abide ſo) the queſtion is of theſe, and to it I anſwer, firſt by conceſſion that growth of grace is required of all as the evidence of its truth; but then I ſay there are ſeveral kinds of growth, and all of them are not neceſſary to this ſtate: as the ſtate is, ſuch is the growth required. There is a growth by addition, and a growth of continuation and perſeverance and going on to the end; that growth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of and is neceſſary to the other ſtates, but this only is neceſſary unto this ſtate of Babes; the others growth is by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5,—11. but Growth of theſe is by abiding in grace: they but con the ſame leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon over and over, when others take out new ones, and turn over leaf. Or as a Tree that grows in a continuance of bringing forth the fruit of its kind, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.11. but if a graft or ſcyon of a nobler fort be ingraſted on or into it, then it brings forth other and better fruit. So that growth in theſe is not a ſuperaddition of new grace, but a renewing of and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their firſt grace. This muſt be the growth of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> or elſe there was none at all, for they were the ſame after a long time that they were before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> puts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> only to prove (for the preſent) that they were in the Faith, and that Chriſt was in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43845:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>though he put the <hi>Hebrews</hi> upon giving diligence to a full aſſurance, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.11. yet on ſuppoſition they ſhould not attain it, he often calls upon them to hold ſaſt and not to apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, concluding that if they did not advance, yet they might be ſaved by abiding in the preſent ſtate, though they were but Babes, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.6,—12, 13, 14. and 10.23,—35. and tells them that the juſt ſhall live by Faith (that which they had) that is, they ſhould continue believing to the end, and not draw back to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To ſeek out this and clear it too, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſome other places, which ſhew that a going on and continuing in the ſame grace, or an holding faſt of what they have is that only which is required of ſome Chriſtians, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24, 25. 'Tis ſaid to them of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> who kept free from <hi>Jeſabels</hi> doctrine, <hi>I will put upon you none other burthen, but that which ye have already, hold faſt till I come, keep your ground;</hi> ſo again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.11. 'tis ſaid to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> who had but a little ſtrength, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Hold faſt that which thou haſt, and to him that overcometh,</hi> &amp;c. So that perſeverance in the little ſtrength that any have, hath the promiſe of Salvation (and is all ſome Saints growth) <hi>He that continueth to the end ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and this is called <hi>overcoming,</hi> which hath the notion of ſome kind of growth in it. And therefore it ſeems clear, that the gain of Babes is in not loſing, and their growth in not decreaſing and declining: or if you had rather expreſs it ſo, the Babes growth is in reiterated
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43845:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>acts of the ſame kind, or in abounding in acts (which is a growing in degrees of the ſame kind) as alſo in deſires after higher attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as I ſhall ſhew anon) eating more and more Milk, repenting more and more, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving more and more, even unto the end, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in theſe things to their fulneſs, and not in paſſing into another ſtate. I ſpeak ſtill of one appointed to this ſtate alone.</p>
                  <p>And on this occaſion before I cloſe up this Chapter, it will not be amiſs to take notice (in relation hereunto) of the Covenant of God made with all Saints, and the promiſes of God made but to ſome Saints; the promiſes of growth (by addition) I humbly conceive are not made to Saints, as ſuch; but to Saints under ſuch a qualification, and acting ſuch and ſuch graces and duties in ſuch and ſuch degrees; as for inſtance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. there is a promiſe of growth; 'tis not every Saint ſhall, but he ſhall: who is that he? <hi>viz.</hi> he that delights in the Law of the Lord, and in his <hi>Law doth meditate day and night:</hi> this medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be to him, as the watering of the River is to a Tree. But now the Covenant (as it gives, ſo it ſecures grace) it is made to and with the loweſt Saint, and warrantiſeth it againſt falling away only, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, and they ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me:</hi> As Chriſt pray'd for <hi>Peter</hi> that his Faith might not (totally and utterly) fail, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32. And this I ſpeak for the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of poor Babes, that they may not ſtamble at this, that they do not grow as others
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43845:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>do; I tell them and would have them bleſs God for it, that they grow with a growth ſuitable to their ſtate, <hi>i. e.</hi> they rely and cleave cloſe, they Apoſtatize not, but hold faſt, they perſevere in eating milk till death them do part; they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the extent of the Covenant, <hi>perſeverance,</hi> and to the end of their Faith, <hi>the ſaving of their Souls.</hi> And this much of the Attainment of Babes in the general.</p>

                  <p>REpentance is the firſt Milk which they ſuck, take in and beſt of all digeſt; they repent not only for but from dead Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch works as they do who are dead in ſins, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. They eſcape the groſs polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are in the world through luſt. The other portion of Milk, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, is of more hard digeſtion with them, and ſtays long in their mouth, before they let it down; For, ſaith the Text, 'tis but Faith <hi>towards</hi> God, it is but in motion and tendency, rather in <hi>fieri</hi> than in <hi>eſſe,</hi> in acting than acted: and this not ſo much and properly towards Chriſt, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God: not excluding Chriſt, but that they have leſs ſtill in exerciſing Faith towards Chriſt, than towards God. But as to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance they are better skill'd and able to act it at a better rate than Faith. In relation to this, there are three things which I ſhall do, 1. Shew that this is the firſt Milk that Babes eat. And 2. That they are better at eating this, <hi>viz.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, than Faith. 3. The nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and how Babes act it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this is the firſt Milk they eat: which will the better appear, by conſidering who have been and are accounted Babes (through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Scripture) as 1. The moſt and generality of the people of God under the old Teſtament: There were indeed ſome Fathers, as <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> but as I may ſay there was but one of a ſort, as <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43845:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>faithful, <hi>Job</hi> of the patient, <hi>Moſes</hi> of the meek, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There were alſo ſome young men, who were ſtrong and overcame the evil one, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> who followed God fully, the Word of God did abide in them; but there were Babes in abundance, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.3, 4. When we were Children (the word is, Babes) <hi>i. e. Verſ.</hi> 4. when we were under the Law, we were in a ſtate of bondage, rather as ſervants, than Children, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. And accordingly the milk given theſe to eat was the doctrine of Repentance (for Chriſt Jeſus was under a vail, and repreſented to them moſtly in types and ſhaddows, and their Faith was but <hi>towards</hi> God and Chriſt.) 2. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's time were but Babes generally, and therefore he alſo fed them with milk, the doctrine of Repentance, yet ſtill directing their Faith to Chriſt who was to come after him: his doctrine and Baptiſm was that of Repentance. 3. In Chriſts time, while in the world, moſt of Diſciples were but Babes (as was hinted heretofore.) And Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gave them Milk for their firſt feeding, yet mixt with Faith, as <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. <hi>Repent and belive the Goſpel,</hi> which he (in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1.) calls the beginning of the Goſpel of Chriſt, as 'tis called in the Text before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. They did alſo believe in God; and our Saviour calls upon them to believe in him alſo, as an advance of their Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. Again, 4. All at firſt Converſion are Babes, and to all theſe is Repentance better known than Faith, for ſome time (more or leſs) and the firſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43845:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>Preach'd to the firſt Converts, was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. and they that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be no more than Babes, feed on this Milk all their daies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I am to ſhew that Babes digeſt this and are better at it, than at Faith, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are beſt at Repentance, 'tis their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, or the chief of their attainments: not that they are better at it than the Saints of higher Forms, but that as they have more need of it, ſo they are more Artiſts at it (it being their trade and calling) than they are at other graces. The beſt of the generality of the Jewiſh Saints under the Old Teſtament lay in repenting and returning (a word in great uſe under that diſpenſation) in weeping and mourning, all which belong to Repentance: So in <hi>John's</hi> time, the fruits were to be ſuch as were worthy of, or agreeable and ſuitable to Repentance, as their higheſt pitch; in Chriſts own time, not only <hi>Peters</hi> weeping bitterly, but other ſuch like Acts were found among the Diſciples, as the beſt of what they had attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to: So in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> this leads the Van, that they repented from dead works; who yet were unskilful as to the word of righteouſneſs. The <hi>Corinthians,</hi> among whom were ſo many Babes, were famous for repenting, as may be ſeen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Having cleared theſe two things, I come now to ſhew briefly,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The nature of Repentance, and how the Babes do act it. As to the nature of it, I ſhall proceed gradually and diſcover it by ſeveral ſteps. The</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:43845:46"/> 1. Whereof is, a ſight and ſenſe of ſin: The firſt work of the Spirit is to convince of ſin, which is not only to let men ſee it, but to make them feel it; that they may be ſenſible what an evil thing it is to be a ſinner.</p>
                  <p>There are indeed ſome common Principles (like ſeeds) ſcattered here and there in the hearts of men that live under the ſound of the Goſpel, before this powerful conviction come upon them, and by which way is made for Converſion. As, not only that there is a God, and that he ought to be worſhipped (which the Heathen alſo have) but that the Will of God is the rule of worſhip, and that this Will and rule is reveal'd in the Scripture, from whence we learn what the good is which we ought to do, and the evil which we ought to leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: that he who tranſgreſſeth this Law doth ſin; that whoever ſins, deſerves the wages of ſin; that all are ſinners; that every ſinner ſtands in need of a Redeemer and Mediator; that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Immanuel,</hi> the Son of God and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is this Redeemer and Mediator; and that the benefit (as to Salvation) which accrews to us from this Chriſt, is by Faith in him.</p>
                  <p>But though theſe Principles be owned by men, and God makes uſe of them to work on men, yet they amount not to a powerful and converting conviction, without a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and ſetting of them home by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. How many have this common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>that they are ſinners,</hi> yea that they are ſuch and ſuch ſinners, as Swearers, Drunkards, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43845:46"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet are far enough from ſeeing the uglineſs and feeling the burden of ſin, ſo as to repent of it. Therefore the conviction I ſpeak of is accompanied with a ſenſe, which is called <hi>pricking at heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2.37.</note> made by a ſpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſin, and uſually (if not alwaies) in the firſt place of one or other particular ſin: For not only common reaſon tells us, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals are known by the particulars wherein they exiſt, but experience alſo tells us, that you ſhall ſcarce find any man, that is convinced of a bad nature, but by a bad life, <hi>The tree is known by its fruit. Hazael</hi> would not believe the Prophet that he had ſuch a dogged nature; No nor <hi>Peter</hi> that he had ſo treacherous an heart, till ſad experience made the conviction by its own breaking out. 'Tis by a particular conviction of ſin, either that of omiſſion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that men come to believe the more general corruption of their nature. When it comes to a <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> 'tis effectual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. And I think that the inſtances of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ones (ſuch excepted as have been as 'twere ſanctified from the Womb) will evince this, that the firſt conviction is from being guilty of a particular ſin; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their confeſſion and reformation begins there.</p>
                  <p>This then is the ſight and ſenſe of ſin which Babes have leading them to Repentance, <hi>viz.</hi> of one or other particular ſin; of ſin in the fruit, more than in the root; of ſinful lives more than of ſinful hearts; though this alſo come on by degrees afterward. The deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43845:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>and deſperate wickedneſs of the heart was a thing that the <hi>many</hi> were not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. No, nor the Diſciples in Chriſts own time, for our Saviour tells them that they were without underſtanding in this point, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.15,—20. And the Apoſtle cautions the <hi>Hebrew</hi>-Babes to take heed leſt there be an evil heart of unbelief or any root of bitterneſs in them, more than they were aware of: Few Babes know what's latent in their hearts. <hi>Peter</hi> tells Chriſt upon occaſion that he was a ſinner, yet would not believe that his heart was ſo ſinful, as Chriſt told him he would find it to be. They are generally (<hi>as</hi> carnal and) like other men in this, who know they ſin, yet ſcarce know whence it comes (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>;) and therefore commonly charge it more upon the Devil than upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and upon his temptations, rather than their own corrupt natures, if not en God himſelf, ſee <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſtep or degree of Repentance is confeſſion of and ſorrow for ſin, (I put them both into one, becauſe they go together) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no true Repentance: 'Tis godly ſorrow that leads to a full Repentance, and this ſorrow cannot be kept in ('tis as coals of fire in the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſom) it breaks out in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, lamentations and ſelf-abhorrency. As there muſt be a ſight and ſenſe, ſo there will be ſighs and groans in true penitents; a woman may as well be delivered in a dream and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain, as a ſoul repent without ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: and where this ſorrow is, it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43845:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>with confeſſions and complaints to God.</p>
                  <p>How theſe things are in and are expreſt by Bibes, I am now to declare, and 'tis thus: The thing which pincheth moſt and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently comes firſt out in confeſſion is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſin they were convinced of. Take a new Convert at Prayers, and I warrant you, that you will hear him telling God ſad ſtories of what he was convinced of, be it good omitted, or evil committed, be it what ſin ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: For I take it to be an infallible rule that according to the ſight and ſenſe, ſuch is the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and complaint; and that being of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſin, this alſo is of the ſame. It is with theſe ſouls, as 'tis with children playing in the duſt, they are not ſo much concerned for all the reſt, as for that which falls into their eyes, they bruſh off the reſt without much ado, but at that in their eyes they ſall a crying. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> (aſſoon as converted) <hi>Behold he prays,</hi> and had you over-heard him, doubtleſs you would have heard ſad bemoanings of his perſecuting the Saints, a thing which ſtuck cloſe to him, as a thorn in his fleſh, all his daies.</p>
                  <p>Beſide this 'tis to be obſerved, that there is a great deal of legal bondage cleaving (as droſs to Gold) unto their ſorrow, for as yet they mourn more for ſin as againſt them and a burden to themſelves, than as 'tis againſt and a burden to God: more as it ſtands in the way of their peace and Salvation, than the glory of God; though that alſo have a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43845:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>little place. <hi>Woe unto us, we have rewarded evil to our own Souls,</hi> ſay they in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: A grown Saint doth not leave out the conſideration of the evil it hath done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he ſorrows for ſin, and God allows it ſhould be ſo, yet this goes moſt to his heart, as it did to <hi>Davids, Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>That againſt thee, againſt thee I have ſinned;</hi> he could better bear his broken bones, his own ſhame and pain, than the ſenſe of this, that he hath grieved and diſhonoured his God: But this is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of poor B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bes (to which yet God will be merciful) that whereas they fetch a ſigh now and then for Gods ſake, they fetch many for their own. They are beſt at that to which nature is aſſiſtant and helpful, as 'tis to ſorrow for ſin, becauſe they have wrong'd themſelves; but Faith and Hope are altogether ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and therefore are more faintly acted by them.</p>
                  <p>Again, you may obſerve in them, that as the ſight and ſenſe of a particular ſin did firſt awaken them, ſo it ſtill ſtartles them, and they think that ſcarce any other, or all the other are ſuch a cloud between God and them as that one ſin; and they ſcarce mind ſo much a general pardon, as the pardon of that one ſin: Indeed they ſometimes cry out in general, <hi>Wretch that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> But their moſt common complaint is of ſuch particular ſins; and of ſuch in which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan generally hath an hand; but as for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret lurkings of luſt, the ſtealings away of the heart from God, private correſpondencies with
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43845:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>pride and worldly love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe things (which are the great tryals and exerciſes of grown Saints) are little taken notice of, or minded by the Babes.</p>
                  <p>Where they do ſorrow, 'tis true they do ſorrow greatly, and ſometimes like <hi>Racbel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be comforted, and are in danger to be ſwallowed up with over much ſorrow, <hi>i. e.</hi> with deſpair; of which there are theſe reaſons, 1. Becauſe they have a ſenſe of ſin but not of forgiveneſs, they are convinced of ſin but not of righteouſneſs: Now though the ſenſe of a pardon do not take away all ſorrow for ſin, yet it takes away the exceſs of it, as alſo the legality, but this being not fully attained by Babes, they ſorrow many times as <hi>men without hope:</hi> and this continues the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, becauſe, 2. They find their corruption yet ſtrong and unmortified: and becauſe 'tis not done, they think it ſhall not be done, but they ſhall one day periſh by the hand of <hi>Saul.</hi> The taſt and tang of their former ſins is (many times by Satan) kept freſh and ſtrong, though they have repented, and therefore they fear and mourn deſperately, but this ſorrow needs ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for, it being ſo droſſie and mercenary, for they even think to make God amends this way, and to compound with God, ſo much ſorrow for ſo much ſin, without eying Jeſus Chriſt (the Propitiation and the Advocate) as they ought. All this (beſide the confirmation that is from experience of young converts) will be evinced by the ſtory of the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. of whom 'tis ſaid in the firſt place,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43845:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>that (after being long dead in ſin) he came to himſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> was convinced of his wicked living, and therewithall of his own loſt undone and periſhing condition, which is the very hinge upon which he turns about to go to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The firſt ſenſe is not of ſin as againſt God (though that came in afterward) but as againſt himſelf: whereupon he takes up a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to go and complain of ſin, and withal that he will indent with God, to ſerve him for wages as an hired ſervant: but aſſoon as the Father had kiſſed him, and aſſured him of his Love, though he go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s on to confeſs his ſin, yet not a word more of being an hired Servant. So theſe poor Babes they come to God with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and indent like hirelings, they are afraid of being damned, and rather than ſo, they will ſerve God with Prayers and Tears day and night; but after God hath kiſt them with the kiſſes of his mouth, they abide in the houſe as Sons that ſerve him, and not as Servants. The grown Saints then, we ſee, do much in a little; when Babes (at and while ſuch) do but a little (though they keep much ado) in all they do. Love and Faith do more in a day, than Fear will be able to do in many daies, or years. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To come to the higheſt ſtep and degree of Repentance, 'tis not only for but from dead works; there is a reformation and fruits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, proper and ſuitable to, this their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Men that repent do not only ſay, What have I done? and mourn for that, but what? Lord! what wilt thou have me to do? and ſo fall into a way of obedience. When <hi>John</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:43845:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Baptiſt called for fruits worthy of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; 'tis very obſervable, that <hi>Luke</hi> 3.7,—14. the people askt, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> Verſ. 10. and the Publicans, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> Verſ 12. and the Souldiers, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> Verſ. 14. To all whom he gives directions to leave their former (particular) ſins, and to lead new lives directly contrary to their former lives; which is the proper fruit of Penitents. When they were prickt at heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. they cryed out, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> And the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do?</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> True Penttents are not only for humiliation, but reformation: they repent not only for, but from dead works, yea the Babes do ſo. How? or in what ſenſe? Thus,</p>
                  <p>Dead works are properly ſuch ſins as they lived in before conviction and converſion, ſuch as are the courſe of the world and of men acted by the Devil, as is clear by <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. There are other ſins which are deadly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (<hi>for to be carnally minded is death,</hi> Rom. 8.6.) which yet cannot in a ſtrict ſenſe be called dead works, which are the ſins of men dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. So that though grown Saints do mortifie, not only the fleſh, but the luſts and affections too, yet Babes ſcarce go further than leaving the works of the fleſh, the ſins in which they lived before converſion; thus did the Prodigal, he ſpent no more of his time and ſubſtance upon Harlots and riotous living. <hi>Zacbeus</hi> begins with mercy and reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution as to any wrongs he had done to any,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43845:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. So <hi>Paul</hi> to Preach the Chriſt and the way which he had perſecuted, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. The Jaylor from making wounds, turns Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion and binds up the wounds which he had made, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. Throughout the Scripture you will find, that babes became clean contrary to themſelves, you ſhall not find them retaining the ſins which they were firſt convinced as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, and this is their Repentance from dead works. And this ſhall ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning the Explication of the firſt attainment of Babes, or their eating the firſt portion of Goſpel-milk, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance from dead works.</p>

In this Text that we are upon, this Doctrine is called a Foundation, and ſurely 'tis not laid in vain.

When the Prodigal came home he put on the beſt robe, and the Ring ('twas ſealing time very early) and the Shoes of the preparation of the Goſpel on his feet, and Bread and Fleſh, ſtrong meat to feed him; when others it may be, though God have compaſſion on them and take them into his Family, and give them Milk to keep them from periſhing with hunger, yet they have not a Ring given them all their daies, nor any thing but Milk to eat; and though they be cloathed with the ſame righteouſneſs for kind, yet 'tis not ſo embroidered, and ſet forth to the eye, as the others was. The Church or Spouſes garment is of diverſe colours.

When the Inceſtuous perſon repented, <hi>Paul</hi> takes care that he may be comforted, leſt he ſhould be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of over-much ſorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. Thus are we given to underſtand how precious the tears of Penitents are, and yet withal that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43845:55"/>God would not that they ſorrow over-much. Though he love to ſee them ſwim in tears, yet he takes care that they may not be drowned (as the word notes) in tears: though he love a broken, <hi>i. e.</hi> a contrite heart, yet he would not that ſuch ſhould break their hearts, or deſpair and mourn as them that are without hope.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. the Spouſe was fallen to the ground (for grief and ſorrow, as I take it) and hid her ſelf in the clefts of the rock and the ſecret places of the ſtairs, and the little Foxes (Satans temptations and wiles) did endeavour to ſpoil the Vine that had but tender grapes; but the Bride-groom, ſeeing her in this diſconſolate condition, beſpeaks her thus, <hi>Riſe up my Love, my fair one and come away,</hi> Verſ. 10. and again <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Let me ſee thy countenance and hear thy voice; Mine O Lord, alas I dare not look up, I am ſo black;</hi> as 'tis ſaid of the poor Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. that he ſtood afar off, and would not lift up his eyes to Heaven, but ſmote upon his breaſt and ſaid, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner:</hi> My countenance, O Lord, 'tis not worth looking on, ſaith this poor ſoul, theſe blubbered checks of mine and eyes ſtanding full of tears will not give me leave to look up: But ſaith he, <hi>Let me ſee thy Face for it is comely;</hi> I love it now the tears run down, I love to ſee it beſet with theſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and ſilver drops of tears, 'tis a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſight in my eyes; and therefore let me ſee thy face; yea and let me hear thy voice; My voice Lord, alas, <hi>I can but chatter as the

This is the beginning of their Faith, and (from this receiving, coming or addreſſing grows up in time reliance upon and truſting in him, though without an aſſurance that Chriſt is theirs and they are his) this I ſay, is ſaving Faith.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore the work of grace is (as experience generally ſhews) a confuſed thing (a kind of Chaos) at firſt, and many things are jumbled together without diſtinct conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and they go puddering on in a dark way; I ſhall therefore indeavour to ſhew the ſeveral workings of it, which it may be theſe ſouls will be better able to aſſent to, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from others, and calling to mind what they have obſerved, than they will be able (otherwiſe) to diſcover and declare it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>We ſee there are two perſons that this Faith of Babes hath to do with, <hi>viz.</hi> God and Chriſt, though God eſpecially and in the firſt place; now how it acts towards God and then towards Chriſt I ſhall indeavour to make plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: and 1. How this their Faith acts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, <hi>viz.</hi> thus: 1. That God is and is a rewarder of them that ſeek him out; for as without this 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God, ſo to come to God in a ſeeking and addreſſing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43845:58"/>way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. There is a Faith called coming, and there is a Faith preceding this coming, which is a believing that God is (for none would look after a non-entity or that which is not, or is not believed to be) and a believing that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him; that they ſhall not ſeek in vain, if they ſeek in truth; now the Babe believes this in general, though it cannot yet ſee its coming and ſeeking to be ſuch as ſhall be welcom and rewarded. As was the caſe of the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Prodigal at firſt. 2. Babes believe this (as to God) that he can turn them, and ſave them if he pleaſe; and this believing his power (though not his will, as grown Saints do) is owned and accepted with great reſpect. When <hi>Ephraim</hi> was bemoaning himſelf, he ſaies, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned;</hi> and God preſently ſaies, <hi>Ephraim is my dear Son, a pleaſant child. I will ſurely have mercy on him, ſaith the Lord. Jer.</hi> 31.18,—20. So the Prodigal believed that his Father could (though he had ſpent all) yet ſet him up again, and that he might be a new-made-man. The Babe ſpeaks like the Leper, <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean,</hi> and it proved ſo. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves there is grace and bread enough in Gods houſe; if he have but will, he hath power enough to pardon: the Queſtion is not about his power but about his Will. Yet throughout the Scripture this is owned and accepted. We read of one poor man that came to Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting his power, but Chriſt-puts him on believing <hi>that</hi> before he would do any thing for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43845:58"/>him; and when he did that, Chriſt did what he came for, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Babes look further, even to the promiſes of God, they find many invitations and promiſes alſo, and they have recourſe to theſe, but do not ſo much mind Chriſt, in whom all the promiſes of God are, yea and <hi>Amen,</hi> ſo that they do as 'twere reſt upon the Ark, but do not come into it: whereas grown Saints, ſee Chriſt Jeſus as the foundation and fulneſs of every promiſe, and do not take up with the Cabinet without the Jewel, or with the Field, without the Pearl hid in it. The Promiſes indeed are incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging means to Faith, but are not the Reſt of the ſoul: Forgiveneſs of ſins is not from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe without Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. nor eternal life it ſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. nor righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. Of this alſo the Babes have a general notion, and ſo they make toward Chriſt, not with full ſails, but with a ſide-wind as 'twere; and this I am now to ſhew, how</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Faith of Babes acts toward Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. And that 1. As the Son of the living God, to whom the Father hath given and committed all things, and this is one of the things which is revealed unto Babes, as is clear by comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16, 17. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 27. When <hi>Peter</hi> confeſt Chriſt to be the Son of the living God, our Saviour calls him bleſſed, and tells him that not fleſh and blood but his Father had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it to him: and in the other place bleſſeth his Father who had hid this (as other things) from the wiſe and prudent, but had revealed them unto Babes. 2. Babes believe that God
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43845:59"/>ſent his Son into the world to ſave ſinners; and 'tis a degree of Faith that Jeſus Chriſt accepts, and commends, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8. Chriſt tells his Father of it by way of commendation, that his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (as yet but Babes) had believed that he had ſent him, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the Meſſiah to reſtore and redeem <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which though ſome of them underſtod (for a while) but carnally, yet they had it ſeems now a better notion of it, and in <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.27. he tells them that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loved them, becauſe they loved him and believed that he came out from God, <hi>viz.</hi> to repair the world. And though they have not yet ſuch diſtinct notions of the Prieſt-hood of Chriſt, of his becoming ſin for them that they might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him (both which are by imputation) yet this general Faith carries them towards Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: this aſſent leads them to an addreſſing Faith, as appears in theſe following diſcoveries of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Faith which they have (as to both God and Chriſt) puts it ſelf forth in purpoſes and reſolutions to go to God, though it be but on a probability or poſſibility (ſuch as that of the Lepers, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.) uncertain hope is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before certain danger and death: No ſooner did the Prodigal believe that in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe there was bread enough, but (on this very account, though he knew not how he ſhould ſpeed) he would venture to go, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than periſh with hunger: and this was firſt in a purpoſe, <hi>I will ariſe go,</hi> &amp;c. Well, ſaith the ſoul, I ſee this, if I live in my ſins I muſt die,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43845:59"/>(ſin and death keep company) but there is mercy with the Lord, he can forgive me, if it ſo pleaſe him; and 'tis <hi>a faithful ſaying and northy</hi> to be received <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſave ſinners;</hi> and though I cannot ſay God will be merciful to me, yet I will ariſe and go, I will adventure, and ſee what he will do with my poor Soul. And truely God takes this kindly (as 'twas ſaid of <hi>David</hi> about building the Temple, that 'twas in his heart to ariſe and go:) theſe firſt motions are very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Faith of Babes (toward God and Chriſt) puts it ſelf forth in Prayers; this Babe not only breaths but cries: as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Paul, Behold be prayeth, Acts</hi> 9.11. This Faith goes with a petition in its mouth, as the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal did, I will not only ariſe and go, but I will ſay too, I will confeſs my ſin, beg pardon, and withal a place in the houſe, though but that of a Servant. So the poor Publican, (yet afar off, as the Prodigal was) <hi>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner;</hi> and this much upon the general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of mercy (for hitherto (ſaith Chriſt of his Babes) ye have askt little or nothing in my name) and he went home juſtified, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. So that God pickt out Faith there, for by Faith (not by Prayer or Repentance) are we juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. This Faith puts purpoſes into Prayers, and Prayers into practice, for the Prodigal aroſe and <hi>came;</hi> and was welcom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore this Faith puts it ſelf in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and in ſubmitting to ordinances, as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſoon as any were new-born, I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43845:60"/>ſpeak <hi>de adultis,</hi> did believe in Chriſt, they were initiated by Baptiſm into the myſteries of Chriſtian Religion; and ſubmiſſion to this was (as to men) a proof of their Faith: and that this was the conſtant courſe appears not only by inſtances, but the Apoſtles conjoyning the doctrine of Faith with that of Baptiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus by degrees doth the Faith of Babes creep and go towards God and Chriſt. But there are yet ſome more inward things, which theſe ſouls (ſome of them, for they are not acted all alike) do find in themſelves, though they can hardly expreſs them diſtinctly, or tell what to make of them. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there be, (for they (ſome of them) are full of its and doubtings, fearing that thee is no work, or that they are but Hypocrites) but ſay they, if there be any true work in us, and wrought by us, 'tis of God; we are wholly beholden to him for it. We cannot juſtifie and warrant our Repentance and Faith for ſound and good; but if there be any ſuch thing, 'tis wrought by God himſelf, for we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think one good thought, in us there dwelleth no good thing. If we are accepted, ſurely 'tis of grace in the beloved: From their Prayers for mercy I conclude that they attribute all to mercy, and ſay, <hi>Thanks be to God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 'Tis, ſaith the poor Soul, 'tis the Lords mercy that I am not in Hell, and if ever I go to Heaven, I will admire grace and mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is this alſo in them, that they have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43845:60"/>a great value for Chriſt Jeſus, though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that he is theirs, or that they are his: they think him the chiefeſt of ten thouſand, and worthy to be beloved and believed in, though they have not attained him, ſo a to lie in his boſome, as <hi>John</hi> did and many others do. If they had ten thouſand worlds, they would give it for him <hi>(for as yet they are for buying and purchaſing, more than for believing)</hi> if he would but ſmile upon them, and kiſs them with the kiſſes of his mouth, oh how would they love him! Higher Chriſtians are rich in experiences, but theſe are rich only in wiſhes, deſires and breathings. They ſo long after him, that they would be content to be (though but as hired Servants) any thing, in any condition, if he will but receive them; yea, if they may but gather the crumbs that fall under his Table, though they ſhould not have the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread beſtowed upon them. If he would but let them know that they ſhall come to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> at laſt, or but open a door of hope for for them, they would willingly go through the Wilderneſs and the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> too, and lay their mouth in the duſt, if there may be but hope. If they may not have a full meal of joy in the Holy Ghoſt, nor rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory, yet they will be thankful for ſome crumbs of comfort, and good hope through grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If theſe longings of theirs may not be ſatisfied, yet this they have fixed and rooted in them, that they would walk in this darkneſs and pain all their daies, rather than go back
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43845:61"/>again to their old condition of living in ſin. They will rather wait and beg at his doors to the death, rather than dwell in the tents or the moſt pleaſant courts of wickedneſs. They will rather be Gods hired ſervants, than the Devils children, and live with the Swine of this world, that wallow in the mire and filth of ſin and iniquity, as you may read in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Prodigal. No, no, they will not go back to Drunkenneſs and uncleanneſs, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and hardneſs of heart; but if they muſt periſh, they will periſh repenting and praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they muſt ſtarve, be it ſo; at Gods door they will lie and beg, come of them what will: they will not go any whese elſe for Salvation. Though he kill them, they will truſt in him, and rely upon him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beſides all this, you will find that theſe Babes will confeſs, that now and then they have ſome ſecret ſoul-ſupporting in-comes, but ſay they, We know not what to make of them, nor whence they come, for they quickly depart again, and our fears return upon us notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Sometime a word hath come and ſaluted them, but it paſſed by and went away. They will tell you, that they had ſuch a <hi>(bath col)</hi> whiſper in their Souls, my grace is ſufficient for thee, or I have prayed that thy Faith fail not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whence it came or whither it went they cannot tell, but alas this they can tell, that it vaniſhed like an Eccho. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples had many a ſupport at times, yet ever and anon were carking, fearing and doubting again, like (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) them of little Faith:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43845:61"/>So theſe poor Souls, though they have now and then a ſecret cordial given them, yet it doth but keep them alive, they are hungry, weak and faint ſtill. Many ſuch things as theſe are with them, and they are (to a grown and knowing Saint, who hath gone through them) very promiſing things concerning the future well-being of theſe Babes, though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſcarce gather hope or not more from them. Thus have I ſhewn how the Faith of Babes doth act, and after what manner they, ſome of them, the loweſt and weakeſt Babes, eat this ſecond portion of Milk, <hi>Faith towards God:</hi> before I ſhew the reſt, I think it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſay ſomething (as to this) by way of</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>TO ſuch as are not Babes, and have not Faith towards God;</hi> Without breach of Charity it may be feared that there are yet more than many, who though they profeſs Faith, do not believe; <hi>The bleating of the Sheep, and lowing of the Oxen</hi> (to ſpeak in <hi>Samuels</hi> language to <hi>Saul</hi>) their living in ſins doth witneſs againſt them. Surely he muſt be very prodigal of his Faith, and have a Creed very large and contradictory to that of the Apoſtles, who can believe unſanctified perſons
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43845:62"/>to be Believers, when the very natural operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and effect of Faith is ſanctification, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. to ſuch therefore would I ſpeak in Chriſt his own words, <hi>Repent and believe the Goſpel;</hi> take in therefore this Milk of the Word, that you may live and grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                  <p>Conſider I beſeech thee, 1. That not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is an Argument of thy not being yet convinced of the ſinfulneſs of ſin, that thou art not yet awakened out of that dead ſleep, not come to thy ſelf; for then undoubtedly thou wouldſt reſolve with the Prodigal to ariſe and go by Faith towards God, and confeſs thy ſin, and beg as the Publican, <hi>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> If thou canſt ſin and ſleep in ſin, if thou canſt lie contentedly in a periſhing and damnable condition, and not cry out for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſurely thou art in a moſt dangerous caſe, notwithſtanding thy name of Chriſtian; for what will it avail thee to have a name to live and yet be dead? If thou tell me thou haſt repented from dead works, I can Anſwer thee it cannot be ſo while thou art dead in ſins and walkeſt in them (for they are dead in ſin, who live in it) <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. But beſide, if that were true that thou hadſt repented, yet know this, that righteouſneſs is not by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance but by Faith; ſo that if thou repent and do no believe, though thou be not far from the Kingdom of Heaven, yet thou art never the near, for the <hi>one thing neceſſary</hi> is wanting; and though thou ſeem too good to go to Hell, yet thou art not good enough to go to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:43845:62"/> 2. Conſider this too that thou haſt had and long had the means of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hearing of the Goſpel by which Faith comes: now what a ſad thing is it to hear of Faith and not feel it, to be a hearer and not a Believer? Have ye not heard? yes the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel hath ſounded loud and long in your ears. 'Tis ſad when the Goſpel comes to thee, and thou doſt not come to God! when it comes in word and not in power! it had been better for thee thou hadſt never heard, than to have heard and not believe. Better thou hadſt never known the way of righteouſneſs, than knowing it not to walk in it. 'Twill be more eaſie for <hi>Turks</hi> than for thee, according as 'twill for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrab</hi> in the day of Judgement than for <hi>Capernaum,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. Theſe things are ſaid (as the Goſpel is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) that you may believe that Jeſus is the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his Name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. And truly if you believe not the Goſpel, neither would you believe if one ſhould come from the dead: the more means of Faith, the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation if men do not believe, and greater means than that of Gods appointing there can be none. And then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider this, that Chriſt may take his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and be gone, &amp; then the things of thy peace may be hid from thine eyes, thou maiſt die in thy ſins and be damned for ever: to day therefore, while 'tis called to day (now or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>i. e.</hi> now or it may never be) hear his voice who calls thee to repent and believe the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43845:63"/>Goſpel that thou maiſt be ſaved; which if thou do not, the ſame Goſpel ſaith, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Canſt have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to think of going to Hell? if not, believe. It were better thou hadſt never been born, than to die without being new-born: 'tis ſad to be dead in ſins, but to die in ſins, Oh who but them in Hell can tell how ſad it is! Hear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and believe that thy ſoul may live.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I am now to addreſs my ſelf to the Babes, eſpecially ſuch of them as lie under deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Spirit; and to you I ſay as before, 1. Deſpiſe not the day of ſmall things: who knows to how great a tree this grain of Muſtard-ſeed may grow? how great a fire this little ſpark may kindle? To how tail a ſtature a poor Babe may grow? though thou canſt eat but Milk, thou maiſt grow thereby. Thou haſt got down one porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Milk more already, and art not only one that repenteſt from dead works, but haſt Faith alſo towards God. Though thou have no Wine, to make thine heart glad, nor oyl to make thy face to ſhine, nor bread to ſtrengthen thine heart, yet bleſs God that thou art alive and haſt milk to eat. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider that thou art gone farther than thou art aware of, thou art nearer Heaven than thou thinkeſt for, in having Faith towards God: though thou be a great way off, yet thou art within thy Fathers ken and view, as 'tis ſaid concerning the Prodigal while he was yet afar off (but a coming, but beginning to come) his Father ſaw him, had compaſſion of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43845:63"/>him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Father ſaw him before he ſaw the Father, and though he were but coming, yet 'tis ſaid he was come; he aroſe and came, <hi>i. e.</hi> was a coming, for as yet he was afar off, and yet 'tis ſaid he aroſe and came; his coming was lookt on as if he were come; as <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to offer his Son in that he did purpoſe and was about to do it, ſo the Prodigal and the Babe is ſaid to be come, though as yet but coming towards God. It's ſomething to be on thy legs, that thy journey is begun (<hi>dimidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um facti qui bene coepit habet</hi>) thou art on thy way, and thy Father ſees it and hath compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on thee, and as to Chriſt Jeſus, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver caſt thee off, no by no means, ſee <hi>John</hi> 6.37,—39.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou never go further than to be a Babe all thy daies, (ſuppoſe that) yet thou art gone far enough to be ſaved: by Faith we are ſaved, as ſafe as if we were ſaved. There is a bleſſing for this Faith, as before, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.17. and Juſtification for this Faith, as before, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.14. and God loves ſuch Believers, as before from <hi>John</hi> 16.27. 'Tis not a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that bleſſedneſs is annexed to the loweſt as well as to the higheſt Form in the School of Chriſt, as in the Beatitudes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and to theſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> Babes the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I hope better things of you</hi> (than of ſome that had been inlightened, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>and things that accompany</hi> or contain <hi>ſalvation</hi> (though you be but Babes) <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9, 10. Salvation is not annexed to degrees (as ſuch) but to truth of grace (as ſuch) in the loweſt degree,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43845:64"/>
                     <hi>John</hi> 6.37. him that is but coming.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As weak as thy Faith is, the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, thou ſhalt be kept through this Faiſh <hi>by the power of God unto Salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. This poor Soul is apt to ſcruple and ſay, Alas, my Faith is but ſmall (if any) and I fear what will become of me in an hour of temptation, my ſtrength is ſo ſmall that I ſhall faint in the day of affliction. But the Lord ſaith to thee, Fear not, for though thou have but a little ſtrength, yet becauſe thou doſt not deny his name, God will keep thee from the hour of temptation, or from the temptation of the hour, as it may be read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8,—10. Though <hi>Saul</hi> purſue thee and hunt thee, yet the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> ſhall grow weaker and weaker, and the houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſhall grow ſtronger and ſtronger, and the weak ſhall be as <hi>David,</hi> who notwithſtanding his fear did not periſh by the hand of <hi>Saul.</hi> Though thy enemies be ſtrong and thy grace weak, yet thy weak grace ſhall be too ſtrong for thy ſtrongeſt enemies: Though the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> be ſtrong, and in thine eyes too ſtrong for thee, yet ſhalt thou die in peace. Maugre all the malice and power of Satan, the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt thee, as Chriſt promiſed <hi>Peter,</hi> who believed as thou doſt, that Chriſt is the Son of the living God: nor did it fail when Satan ſiſted him, for though he denied that he knew the man, he yet ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that Chriſt was the Son of God, which was the Faith that Chriſt prayed might not fail. Let the rain deſcend, the floods come, and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43845:64"/>winds blow and beat (all together) upon thee, yet thy houſe ſhall ſtand, for 'tis founded (like Mount <hi>Sion</hi>) on a rock that cannot be moved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.24, 25. Indeed if thy Faith alone were to buckle with Satan, 'twere <hi>impar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſus</hi> an unequal match, but thou art kept by the power of God, and the Prayer of Chriſt, ſo that there is more power for thee, than there is againſt thee, though it be all the power of Hell.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe experiences which thou haſt at preſent are ſuch as none but a true Saint ever had or can have; the moſt exquiſite hypocrite that ever was, never attained to what thou haſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to be new-born and to be a Babe in Chriſt. To which of the Saints wilt thou turn? ask them one by one whether ever any that caſt themſelves upon the grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus (as thou doſt) did ever periſh, or that their hope was aſhamed? No, no, the hypocrites hope ſhall periſh, though he have gained a great name and repute, but thine ſhall not, though thou be but poor in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and one of the leaſt of many thouſands. If thou canſt but Seal to the workings of Faith (before ſpoken of) and I know thou canſt if in Chriſt Jeſus, though but a Babe in him, I then ſay, 'tis more than the exacteſt, moſt ſtudied and poliſht hypocrite ever did or can attain to. An hypocrite may be gilded over, but thou art Gold; he may be enlightened, but thou art light in the Lord; he may grow up as the graſs, but thou as a tree planted and rooted in Chriſt Jeſus; he may ſeem to be, but thou art a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43845:65"/>Chriſtian: what ever may be counterfeited, the new-birth cannot be counterfeited.

               <head>III. <hi>Of their ſubmiſſion to Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THE two next things (of the ſix) which follow, are to ſhew not only the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which was taught to Babes, but alſo their ſubmiſſion thereunto, and are proofs (before men) of their converſion. As to the things themſelves (Baptiſmes and laying on of hands) there is ſome difference, if not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie among Interpreters. Of the Doctrine of Baptiſm, (<hi>gr.</hi> Baptiſmes) ſome ſay this, That it refers to the ſeveral waſhings uſed by the Jews, one of which was with reference to the admiſſion of Proſelytes, to which Baptiſm ſucceeded; others, that it refers to both the outward and inward Baptiſm, that of water, and this of the Spirit. Of the Doctrine of laying on of hands; ſome ſay, that it refers to confirmation; others, to abſolution; others, to ordination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſeems to be the practice of Chriſts Apoſtles after they had Baptized perſons (ſooner or later) to lay hands on them, by which gifts were conferred, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. and 19.4,—6. with many other places: Now, whether the Doctrine of Baptiſmes may not refer to the Baptizing of Gentiles as well as Jews; and laying on of hands alſo refer to both (a thing which the Jews could hardly bear) I ſubmit to the conſideration of others. As to our preſent purpoſe (not to meddle with Controverſies) I do conceive that by theſe two things is noted in general, how Babes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43845:67"/>do ſubmit and give up themſelves to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch inſtitutions, duties and ordinances as they are capable and convinced of: And further than this I ſhall not handle the Doctrine of Baptiſmes, and laying on of hands: and this all agree in.</p>
               <p>Babes do ſubmit to ſuch ordinances, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as (I ſay) they are capable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, for of all they are not, nor are they required at their hands, till in a capacity: What ever Doctrine comes under the name of ſtrong meat, they cannot bear. Our Saviour would not put meat into Babes mouths, no more than men would put new Wine into old Bottles; and therefore they were not put upon faſting, (for want whereof in part they could not caſt out one kind of Devils, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.19,—21.) till Chriſts departure and the delcent of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.14,—17. This duty of faſting (how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally ſoever uſed by the Phariſees) is a duty too ſtrong for Babes to be put much upon. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had many things (more) to ſay, which they could not bear till the Spirit came upon them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.12, 13. they could hardly endure the doctrine of Chriſts death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.21, 22. they underſtood it not, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.44, 45. nor the doctrine of his Reſurrection, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.9, 10. nor that of his Aſcenſion to the Father and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.16,—18. which are the ſtrong meat that grown Believers feed upon (as they alſo afterward did) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. they were, while Babes, exceeding ſorry at theſe things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.22, 23. which yet were to turn to their greateſt joy after they came to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43845:67"/>a riper underſtanding of his Love and deſign herein, as Chriſt told them it ſhould, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.19,—28. and ſo ſtrong Believers find it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34,—39. he had ſome things alſo to tell them by way of Command, as that they ſhould go and Preach to the Gentiles, Baptize and lay hands on them alſo, which as yet they could not bear: and while they were under this weakneſs, their firſt Commiſſion was but for the Cities of <hi>Judaea.</hi> Yea after Chriſts Aſcenſion, <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf was not convinced but by a Viſion, that they might go to the Gentles; and 'twas a matter of great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Jewiſh Converts (who generally were but Babes) that to the Gentiles God had granted Repentance to life, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. and as they were Babes in point of gifts (for they were to do greater things after Chriſts Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than they could before, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.12. <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as we read of, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15,—20. which was much beyond (both for the perſons to be Preacht to, and things to be done by them in) the firſt Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.1.) ſo were they Babes in grace alſo, (they were but of little Faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.30.) they were very carnal in their apprehenſions of Chriſts Kingdom, as if it had been of this world; they were very dull of hearing the Doctrine of his death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as was toucht even now; there was much ſtrife and envy among them; and a wrathful ſpirit calling for fire from Heaven; they were forward to promiſe, but not ſo to perform, for they could not watch with him one hour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears they were as carnal and but Babes, not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43845:68"/>capable of ſtrong meat for Doctrine or duty.</p>
               <p>What they (Babes) are, and what they are not capable of or able to bear, I ſhall not undertake to determine, only this I am ſure of, that they are not to be received to doubtful diſputations (if that be the meaning of the place) <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. of which I think the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent gives a better account. But now, what they are capable of and convinced of, that they ſubmit to and act accordingly, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. There were Diſciples that had not heard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were an Holy Ghoſt or no, but as ſoon as they were convinced they ſubmitted. The Diſciples were not convinced of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiahs Offices, but in the general notion (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinct apprehenſions of the manner and way) of reſtoring the world; and therefore till after his Aſcenſion, which proved theirs too, they had asked nothing in his name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.24,—26. Chriſt indeed had declared his Fathers name <hi>(The Lord gracious)</hi> and taught them to Pray, <hi>Our Father,</hi> and tells God that they had kept his Word, and believed that he came out from him, as ſent by him, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.6,—8. but a more particular Faith in him, and praying in his name (was to be taught by the Spirit, and) were things they were not yet convinced of.</p>
               <p>The great thing I have now to do is to ſhew, how and after what manner theſe Babes attend upon Ordinances and do their duties: which, alas, is in a very poor low way, the weakneſſes whereof God overlooks, and accepts their will for the deed (and better than that) many times.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:43845:68"/> 1. They are more at duty than in it, and uſe Ordinances much, but make little uſe of them, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) are very full of duties, but little dutiful; very little comes of all their attendance upon and addreſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, they are where and as they were ſtill, little earnings do they make, God knows. They drive a great trade at hearing and praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hear precept upon precept, and line upon line; heap duty upon duty, but are very bunglers at it, and unprofitable after it. Like young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that make many meals, eat all the day long, and ſpoil as much as they eat, they man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and crumble what is ſet before them, and dwindle away their time without feeding. Thus it was with the <hi>Hebrew</hi>-Babes, they did eat and eat, yet were alwaies in need of milk, they do not, cannot walk in the ſtrength of their meat (as the Prophet did) but are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry again preſently; the Word profits them little becauſe not mixed with Faith, they have a bad digeſtion, and as ill a concoction; ſo that though they eat much, they are lean from day to day. The Diſciples who heard Chriſt Jeſus Preach ſo often were yet (like the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>) dull of hearing, and ever and anon were to know the meaning of this and that very plain and eaſie Similitude and Parable with which Chriſt taught them, and underſtood not this and the other ſaying. They were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with praying, that they muſt needs have a Form of Prayer, or a Directory ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Though the Jews faſted often, yet to God not at all or very little; they abound
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43845:69"/>in performances, and keep on the road and round of duties, yet make no riddance not work of it; there is little Faith in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, little love in their loving, little obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in their obeying: there is much of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, but little of quality; there is a great bulk of duties, but little of Spirit and life in them: their much is little.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are very apt to place Religion in and to confine it to ſome certain duties, and ſay, <hi>'Tis good to be here</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> did) not knowing what they ſay. They are apt to think that nothing is duty (and that they muſt ſcarce do any thing elſe) but to hear and pray: if I may allude to what is ſaid of the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23. they are exact and punctual at poſitives, but defective in morals, they too much neglect the weightier things, as Faith and Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas a grown Chriſtian ſees that the great part of his duty is in a faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his particular calling, in buying and ſelling, eating and drinking, and doing all he doth (from the higheſt to the loweſt duty) to the glory of God. The Babes are, as I may ſay, hearing and praying Chriſtians, and ſo are the grown Chriſtians alſo, but withall they are doing and practiſing Chriſtians which the Babes are but a little acquainted with. When Jeſus Chriſt had caſt a Devil out of a man, he that had been poſſeſt prayed that he might be with him, but Chriſt had other work for him to do, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.18, 19. ſo theſe Babes cry to be with him (for ſo they call being at Sermons and Prayers) little conſidering that they may
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43845:69"/>ſerve him better in being elſewhere many times: theſe things ought ye to do, and not to leave the other undone, ſay I to the Babes, as Chriſt did to the Phariſees. Conſtant walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, and finiſhing the work he hath given us to do, is the beſt being with him, and therein properly is our communion with him (to which hearing and praying is but relative, as means and helps to ſuch an end) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6, 7. Oh that Babes would learn this. For young beginners think they muſt lay almoſt all aſide in compariſon of hearing and praying, as if following their callings, and doing the work of their places were nothing to this, but (as <hi>Spira</hi> thought at the beginning) that they muſt lay aſide all and live upon providence: whereas the excellency of a grown Saint is much in this that he divides his work aright, and gives every one its portion in due ſeaſon, for then 'tis beautiful; and ſo is he (in this ſenſe alluding to 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15.) approved of God, a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are apt to place more in Ordinances and duties, and to look for more from them, than God hath placed and put in them. They go to them as <hi>Rachel</hi> to <hi>Jacob, Give me Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or I die;</hi> but they may Anſwer (as he did her) <hi>Am I in Gods ſtead? if God ſhut who can open?</hi> Poor Babes, if they have not what they have a mind to, they take pet, are ſullen and diſcontented; what ſhould I hear, pray and wait for? they did look for joy, but none came; they went to hear the joyful ſound, but heard it not; they went to the Lords Feaſt, as to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43845:70"/>a ſealing ordinance, but found no impreſſions of its Seal: and therefore are apt to complain, why ſhould I go any more? but let me tell you this is your Babiſheſs: as that King ſaid to the Woman who came to him for help, ſo may Ordinances ſay to you, how can we help if God do not help? God hath not called Ordinances and duties your comforters, but his holy Spirit is the comforter; the partaking of the Lords Feaſt doth not Seal, 'tis the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits office: God never intended that you ſhould make Gods and Saviours of his Ordinances, but that you ſhould look through them and above them, while you uſe them; grown Saints do ſo: they go to (and alſo go from) a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ordinance to God himſelf: They know 'tis not the man that ſpeaks the word, nor the word that man ſpeaks, but God that works. They go to them as to Gods Wells and Conduit pipes, which they know have no water but from the Fountain, in whom all their freſh Springs are, and from whom all their fruit and increaſe is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. <hi>Pauls</hi> planting, and <hi>Apollo</hi>'s watring comes to nothing, if God do not give the increaſe by his bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Babes (ſome of them) are too prone to think that they deſerve ſomething at Gods hand by what they do (being yet under the bondage of hired Servants, and an Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment legal frame) they do not ſo much work righteouſneſs, but they as much work for righteouſneſs: they think to pray and weep themſelves into the Love of God, and are as carnal men, who think to be heard for their
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43845:70"/>much and long ſpeaking, they are much for vows and Covenants, they ſet tasks on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo many Chapters, ſo long at Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if they fail of their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then they are apt to ſay, What profit is there if we keep his Ordinances? and what gain if we draw nigh unto him, and have hands laid on us? and why have we afflicted our Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like them in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2, 3. If they do any thing with inlargedneſs, and as they think better than ordinary, they then conclude (as <hi>Leah</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.20.) <hi>God hath endowed me with a good Dowry, now will he dwell with me, for I have born him Six Sons;</hi> and they call their duties <hi>Zebulun</hi>'s, i.e. dwellings. If they find ſome enlargement in duty and bring forth ſuch things plentifully, then ſay they, ſhall we have ſomething from Heaven to day, a ſmile or a token for good, becauſe we have prayed with ſighs and tears as well as groans to day, and attended upon Ordinances with longings to day; now we ſhall be Gods darlings, ſurely he will make much of us: they being ignorant of Gods (word of) righteouſneſs, go about to eſtabliſh their own, and look for acceptance and manifeſtations of love from their humblings and Prayers (which is to be had in, by and through Chriſt only) and ſo they attain it not, becauſe they ſeek it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32. with 10.2.3, 4. Their hopes of Heaven, and thoughts of Gods love do flow and ebbe, are higher or lower, according to the workings of their heart in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43845:71"/>their duties: They rejoyce in theſe things as the Diſciples did at the ſubjection of Devils, more than (as grown Saints do) that their names are written in Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17,—20.</p>
               <p>They promiſe themſelves great matters from their performances, and ſubmiſſion to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as if <hi>opus operatum</hi> the work done did deſerve ſomething: My beloved I ſpeak not theſe things to ſhame you, but (as <hi>Paul</hi> did to his <hi>Corinthian</hi>-Babes) as my beloved ones to warn and inſtruct you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to clear this a little more, I intreat you to obſerve, that when Chriſt had told the young man that if he would leave all and follow him, he ſhould have treaſure in Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.21. almoſt immediately thereupon, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>Behold we have left all and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thee, what ſhall we have therefore?</hi> this was a Babiſh expreſſion, as if they had deſerved ſome great matter: pray what was this <hi>all</hi> he talks of? 'twas a great <hi>all</hi> indeed! a poor little Fiſher Boat, and an old Net, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and was not this worthy to be uſhered in with a <hi>behold?</hi> and concluded with a <hi>what ſhall we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</hi> Alas poor Babes, they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very profitable ſervants, as our Saviour intimates to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.7, &amp;c. to what purpoſe doth Chriſt tell them this ſtory, but to let them know that he owes them no thanks, that they are ſervants to whom he is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden, for they had done but what was (and not all that was) their duty to do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore makes the Application, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43845:71"/>ye, when ye have done all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ye to do, ſay (ſit down and write at the end of your accounts) we are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants. Thus he reproved them for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a reward as due; Chriſt will reward them, not as debt, but by the gift of grace.</p>
               <p>Take now a grown Saint, and he looks upon his all to be ſo little, and his beſt ſo bad, that he knows himſelf in debt to God, and not God in debt to him: he gives God but his own, what he firſt received, and which is ſtill Gods due, and never thinks that he merits by paying his debts and doing what is his duty to do. When ſuch an one hath done any thing for God, he is ſo far from demanding a reward of debt, that he looks for it only as a gift, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. and doth not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the reward only to gift and grace, but all the duty and work which he hath done, and thanks God for it too, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. he looks on himſelf as needing Chriſt Jeſus for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, not only after his ill doing, but after his well doing, and would not be found in any righteouſneſs but that which is by Faith for all the world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. when he hath done all his duty, he looks upon himſelf as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant, as well as he doth when he falls ſhort of doing all his duty, or as if he had not done any thing at all, as they <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.37.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They too often value Ordinances accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diſpenſer and adminiſtrater of them. Some of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Babes gloried that they were Baptized by <hi>Paul,</hi> others that it was by <hi>Apollo,</hi> others that 'twas by <hi>Cepbas,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12,—16.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43845:72"/>So as to Preaching, they are apt to confine God to ſuch a man or ſuch a ſort of men; and like the ſame truth better if one man deliver it, than if another; and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receive the Sacrament (as 'tis called) from ſuch a man, than from ſuch a man: thus Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhly partial are theſe poor Babes. 'Tis true indeed God may make one mans Miniſtry more uſeful than anothers, and that doth much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear the man and his Miniſtry to ſuch perſons as have ſate under it and felt it: but when people are divided by this and puſſed up for one againſt another, 'tis then (as carnal) as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, and the Apoſtle chides them for it, as for a Babiſh trick, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. When men are not taken with the Ordinance as Gods, but as mans, 'tis Babiſh; as 'tis noble indeed to receive the Word not as mans but Gods, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. to overvalue one and undervalue another, or to value the Word of God for the mans ſake, is a fooliſh and Babiſh thing. Take a grown ſpiritual Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and ſo he be built up in the holy Faith, and taught the way of God more perfectly, teach him <hi>Paul,</hi> or teach him <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> 'tis all one to him, yea though it be <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> Acts 18.24.—26. Babes cannot ſay ſo, they muſt hear their <hi>Paul, Apollo, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> or no body: ſo if they be to joyn in Prayer, they are dull and dead if ſuch or ſuch an one do not pray and be their mouth to God: whereas an intelligent Saint it may be finds more, much more of Gods Spirit breathing in one, that theſe Babes cannot have the patience
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43845:72"/>to hear. Many more ſuch things are with you, poor Babes, but as yet I ſpare you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Theſe Babes are ſometimes ſenſible of their weakneſs and inability as to outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, but are not ſo much obſervant and ſenſible of their inward defects, as ſecret pride and confidence in what they ſeem to do well at any time: they ſay, as the Diſciples, <hi>Why could not we caſt him out?</hi> Matth. 17.19. they were aware that there was a defect of power, for they attempted to do it, but could not: yet when at other times the Devils were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them, there was a ſpice and tang of pride attended their rejoycing at it, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17.21. and though Chriſt thanked his Father for what they had received, yet he calls them Babes, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. this word <hi>us,</hi> the Devils are ſubject to <hi>us,</hi> ſeems to take away a ſhare from Chriſt, though they ſay, through thy name. And you ſhall find that after they had received the Spirit and were grown to a more ſpiritual condition, that they wholly lay the <hi>us</hi> aſide and give all the glory to God in Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.12, 13. why gaze ye on, as if <hi>we</hi> by <hi>our</hi> power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God hath glorified his Son Jeſus. Now you ſee the <hi>us</hi> is laid aſide, and they do not run ſhares with Chriſt as they did before. So 'tis with Babes as to ordinances and duties, they find a weakneſs, they cannot do what they endeavour to do, to will is preſent but to do they have not power, this they are aware of; but now, when they meet with any power and ſtirrings and inlargements, they are apt to be lifted up, and if not to reſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I paſs from hence to ſpeak a little to theſe Babes by way of</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>Application.</head>
                  <p>THeſe things being ſo (which you cannot well deny, poor Babes) let me beſpeak you and exhort you,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To Conſider not only what you ought to do, but how you ought to do it, not only the matter but the manner of all duties; and to meaſure your obedience more by the quality than the quantity, the weight than number of it, together with what ends you have in it: 'tis not the bigneſs or juicineſs of the fruit, but the reliſh that gives the commendation, and that is the end you have in doing your duties. If thy obedience have not a good reliſh (<hi>ad guſtum Dei</hi>) if it do not taſte well, though thy duties be never ſo many and well coloured and full of enlarged affections, they are not acceptable to God, nor a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to him. The uſual queſtion that Babes make is about the <hi>what</hi> of duty, <hi>what</hi> ſhall we do? ſay they, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>what</hi> muſt I do, ſaith the Jaylor? Lord, <hi>what</hi> wilt thou have me to do? ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> They mind the matter of duty and ask often about the <hi>what:</hi> but as we ſhould mind <hi>what</hi> to hear and do, ſo <hi>how</hi> to hear and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43845:73"/>do. We ſhould not only receive the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but ſo as to diſcern the Lords Body; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray, but pray according to his Will; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit to Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but mind the <hi>how</hi> and <hi>why,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3,—5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11,—13. God doth not look ſo much to the hand as to the heart, to the action as to the Spirit by which, and the end for which 'tis done. The rich men threw in much more for quantity than the Widdow, yet her Mite was more than their abundance: there may be more of prayer in a ſhort Ejaculation, than a long prayer of many words. God is taken more with a little well done, than with much good done: <hi>Deus magis delectatur adverbiis quam nominibus;</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs ſet out God beſt, as all that he did was good <hi>exceedingly,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt is not only true, but (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>A little Gold refined is more worth than much in the Oar, and one Diamond hath more of value in it than a heap of common ſtones. A contracted Prayer may have more in it than a long one; not that I ſpeak againſt the inlargedneſs of any perſons affections in duty, for if God opens who can ſhut? but that none ſhould place the excellency of a duty in length, or meerly in fervency, for many things may occaſion it, when it may not be fervency of ſpirit wrought by the Spirit of God. 'Tis not how much but how well, not how affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate but how ſpiritual, that God minds: many
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43845:74"/>Lads when they begin to write, ſtrive to write much, but ſaith their Maſter, write me two lines well and I will take it better, than if you ſcrible and ſcrawle a ſide of Paper: <hi>Sat' &amp; ſat' cito ſi ſat' bene.</hi> 'Tis not worſhipping at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> but in ſpirit and truth that God minds; and as 'tis to place, 'tis to bulk, To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices? 'Tis a broken heart that I will not deſpiſe. The Apoſtle doth not take care only to pray or ſing, but to do it with underſtanding and his Spirit alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. ſpiritual things ſhould be done ſpiritually; we ſhould not only do the things which are pleaſing to God, but do them ſo that the doing of them may be pleaſing to him; his Will according to his Will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider what is the true ſtate, condition and deſign of Ordinances and Duties; they are not your food, but the diſhes in which your food is ſet before you; not the water of Life, but the Conduit pipes through which 'tis conveyed to you; 'Tis not the end of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and duties that you ſhould make them your end; no, they are but means to an end: would you take up with food or Phyſick with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out health? why then with Ordinances with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power, bleſſing and effects of them? Though I ſpeak not this to take you off from Ordinances and Duties, yet that you may not look for that there which God hath not placed there, not have that value for them and truſt in them which is due to the God of Ordinances: live not without Ordinances, but live above them while you uſe them.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:43845:74"/> 3. Be more univerſal in your obedience and do not confine Religion to certain daies and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: God is the univerſal good, and we are moſt like him, when we are univerſally ſo: <hi>Then ſhall we not be aſhamed, when we have reſpect to all his Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.6. 'Twas the great commendation of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that they walked in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and Ordinances of God without blame. They did not pick and chooſe ſome, make <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands</hi> as to others; but were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed lovers of all. And here is love that we keep his commands, <hi>viz.</hi> all of them, and they (not any of them) are not grievous, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. Every creature is good in one or other reſpect, they are particular goods, this or that; but God (as I ſaid) is all good, and doth good to all: all his commands alſo are holy, juſt and good, and we ſhould ſtudy to know, &amp; do all the good and acceptable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. to be as like God, and to do all that God likes, as much as poſſible.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Obſerve the proper ſeaſon of Ordinances and Duties, of Hearing and Praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon: 'Tis the glory of the Tree planted by Preaching, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by Baptiſm, bleſſed with the laying on of hands, to bring forth fruit in ſeaſon; for as it follows (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7.) the earth which drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the rain, that cometh oft upon it (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on precept, and line on line) and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth herbs meet (ſuitable and ſeaſonable) for them by whom it is dreſt, receiveth bleſſing from God; which refers to the Parable of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43845:75"/>good ground hearers, as what follows, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. refers to the thorny ground. There is a time for all things, and becauſe man knoweth not his time, his ſorrows are great upon him: 'tis unſeemly for a man to mourn in a time of joy, as 'tis to rejoyce in a time of mourning. To ſpeak more to Babes, 'tis not beautiful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſeaſonable to be praying in a time that calls for another duty, or to be hearing when it may be ſome duty in your calling or Family calls upon you to be then and there to mind that. Babes are too apt to rob <hi>Peter</hi> to cloath <hi>Paul,</hi> to take from one duty and give to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore I ſpeak thus unto them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Do what you do more out of ingenuity than fear, and more out of thankfulneſs and gratitude than cuſtom or conſtraint. Many carnal ones come as the people cometh, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, cuſtom, and the Bell, more than Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, tolls them to Ordinances; and too often Babes in Chriſt are in this <hi>as</hi> carnal, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do not ſo properly come as are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and forced to Ordinances and duties: There is a thing called Conſcience which when 'tis awakened keeps a great deal of do; and when men are convinced of ſin they will do almoſt any thing for caſe and quiets ſake; and when they have been uſed to hear and pray and have found ſome relief by it, they are under a kind of bondage and dare not omit it (though perhaps it be not a ſeaſon) for fear Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould flie in their face, they are afraid 'twill chide and whip them; and therefore to prevent this they will to hear and pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:43845:75"/>Yea, but if thou wilt do any thing well, do it from a better nature, from ingenuity, and a child-like ſpirit, as one ſenſible what obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lie upon thee not to ſin and to be dutiful, though there were no threatnings nor terrors that attended the omiſſion of good nor commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of evil.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Go on to attend upon and addreſs to God in the way of his Ordinances and your Duties, though you ſhould not meet with all that incouragement which you look and long for: commit your ſelves to God in all waies of well-doing, though you have not ſuch joyes and raviſhments as ſome have and you deſire. Do not ſerve God meerly for incomes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, be more generous and noble, and think it a great honour that thou canſt ſerve him and do thy duty. 'Tis true, God hath made all our duties priviledges, and in as well as after keeping his Commands there is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, his ſervice is not only a means but a part of our happineſs; yet we ſerve him beſt when we do our duty, more as duty which refers to God, than as priviledge which refers to us: and a generous ſoul will ſerve God and thank him that it may, and more that it can, though it have not a penny for its pains and labour, though it ſhould bear the burden and heat of the day. 'Tis not an ingenuous child that will not be obedient longer than it is allured and bribed by fine things.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a greater honour to us that we ſerve God, than 'tis to him that we do ſerve him; as 'twas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43845:76"/>much and great Faith will help thee to do much and great work.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And laſtly, look to Jeſus Chriſt and rowl thy ſelf on him notwithſtanding thou do all things well. We need not only a Chriſt for the doing of duty, without whom we can do nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. and through whom we can do all things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. But we need a Chriſt for the acceptance of what we do; even our fruits of righteouſneſs are not acceptable, but by him (in whom we are accepted) our moſt ſpiritual ſacrifices muſt be offered on this Altar and by it ſantified, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. We need a Chriſt not only to bring us to God at firſt, but alwaies and for ever. As our ſin is pardoned, ſo our duties are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for Chriſt his ſake. Chriſt is all and in all. Do all thou canſt as if there were no Chriſt, and after that relie on Chriſt as if thou hadſt done nothing, as well as thou didſt or ſhouldſt at firſt when thou hadſt done nothing.

                  </gap>te, for then were true Chriſtians <hi>of all men moſt miſerable,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>I intend not any large or long Diſcourſe about the Reſurrection and Judgement to come, but only ſo much as ſerves to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew the attainment of Babes,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43845:80"/>in relation to which I ſhall briefly inquire, 1. What Reſurrection and Judgement is here meant. And 2. how the belief of this doth influence Babes, and what that attainment is which reſults from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is here meant. We may in the firſt place here underſtand the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt from the Dead, by which we are begotten again to a lively hope, or hope o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. And when the Apoſtle reckons up the grounds of our rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus, as being by him freed from condemnation, he puts a <hi>rather</hi> upon his Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. And when he writes to the <hi>Corinthian</hi>-Babes about the Reſurrection, he begin with this as the foundation of all, that <hi>Chriſt died and roſe again,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.3, 4. and thence proves the general Reſurrection, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Agreeably and in a correſpendent ſenſe to this, by the Eternal Judgement, we may underſtand that the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning mens Eternal conditions is committed to Chriſt: that he (who is raiſed and is the Reſurrection) will raiſe the dead, and Judge the dead to their Eternal ſtates after he hath raiſed them; ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 10.41, 42. and 17.31 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. But for fear (and indeed I do fear) that Babes may not have ſo diſtinct and exact a knowledge of this, as other Saints have, I ſhall pitch upon another ſenſe and fix in it. 'Tis this,</p>
               <p>That Babes do in the general believe that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of all perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Judgement, and a Judgement of all perſons to an Eternal (good or evil) ſtate, (and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43845:80"/>therefore 'tis called an Eternal Judgement) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>The time is coming in the which all that are in the Graves ſhall hear his</hi> (the Son of mans) <hi>voice and ſhall come forth, they that have done good to the Reſurrection of Life, and they that have done evil unto the Reſurrection of Damnation</hi> (ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31,—46. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6,—16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5,—10.) They ſhall come forth, there is the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to life or damnation, there is the Eternal Judgement. There are many ſpecial things about the Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Babes are not very capable of, and of which I ſhall ſay nothing now, but this, they do believe in the general that ſuch a thing there will infallibly be as a future Eternal ſtate of happineſs or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to men, according to what they have done in this life: and they that believe not this are but falſely called Chriſtians, or by the favour of a Synecdoche, which puts a part for the whole. A Saint not believing a life to come, is no leſs than a contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps 'twill be objected that a man may be in Chriſt though but a Babe and <hi>as</hi> carnal, and yet not believe this doctrine of the Reſurrection, for among theſe <hi>Corinthian</hi>-Babes ſome it ſeems did not own it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I Anſwer, That by the <hi>ſame among you</hi> may not be meant the <hi>Corinthians</hi> themſelves (for 'tis not ſaid ſome of you) but falſe teachers that came among them; who were (it may be) worſe and more infidels than <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who ſaid the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43845:81"/>was paſt already, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18. For theſe ſaid there was none at all; which indeed was to deny Chriſt to be riſen, and he that doth ſo, cannot be a Chriſtian, not a Babe in Chriſt; but in this Faith that Chriſt was riſen the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> did ſtand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 4. therefore I conceive they were ſome among them, but not of them, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19 (however the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God ſtandeth ſure, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. which is ſpoken upon a reſembling occaſion) and the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak this ſo much by way of charge as caution, of accuſation as warning, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 34. I ſpeak this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to your warning, that you may fear and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of ſuch Sadducees who have not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God nor Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.29. and whoſe evil words and <hi>Epicurean</hi> language is apt to beget ill manners. So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Objection 'tis clear enough, that he cannot be a true Chriſtian, no, not of the loweſt Form, who believes not the Reſurrection of the Dead and Eternal Judgement.

And this though Chriſt have died, for want of particular application of it to themſelves; which grown <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Babes are fearful; yet God makes uſe of this fear and trembling to many and great uſes for their good and his glory: it lays a great reſtraint upon them as to ſin, and (as love doth others) it conſtrains them to obedience.

Now that which is of moſt uſe to perſwade men, is of moſt uſe to perſwade Babes, who are as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and walk <hi>as</hi> men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 3. 'Tis worth our while to take notice what and how many things are back't by this Argument of judgement to come and the terrour of the Lord. I will but touch them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis an Argument to provoke to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30, 31. And this is Babes milk, which they are perſwaded to take by this Argument, that there will be a Judgement Day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis an Argument for Faith and Baptiſm too, as they are conjoyned here, and <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> the fear of this dreadful after-clap of damnation drives many in to Faith and Baptiſm. It per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades men to fear God and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Eccl</hi> 12.13. this perſwades men to be moderate in the uſe of worldly injoyments, which belong to the ſenſual and animal life, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.9, 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34,—36. It per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades men to embrace and improve Goſpel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and the means of grace, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour hints, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.20,—24. It perſwades men not to cenſure, judge, deſpiſe and revile
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43845:82"/>one another (which Babes are apt to do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2.) I ſay it perſwades them not to do ſuch things, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3,—5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4, 5. with <hi>Jude</hi> 15. It perſwades to patience, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.8. It perſwades to abide in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and not to Apoſtatize, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.28. It perſwades men to watch and be ready, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.1,—7. In a word 'tis a very powerful Argument to engage to every duty and to ſerve God acceptably, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 9, 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28, 29.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee of what huge uſe it is to believe the doctrine of the Reſurrection and Eternal Judgement, as Babes do; and do it with fear and trembling. 'Tis true indeed that love (which acts the more grown Saints) is the more generous and noble principle, yet fear is of great uſe too, for the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom, as love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law; and under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (when men were generally Babes) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is as much expreſt by and called fear, as under the New Teſtament 'tis by Faith and Love: which two Babes are not wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of, though they be acted moſt by fear. The Babes Faith is a fearful Faith, which argues its imperfection; but the grown Saints fear is full of Faith which is an Argument of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: for it loves to pleaſe the God it fears, and fears to offend the God it loves. Self preſervation is natural to men, and fear hath is great influence on men to avoid what will hurt them, as love hath to do what will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43845:83"/>them. 'Tis true, fear hath torment (which perfect love caſts out) but yet it tends to the eſcaping of a greater torment, and is therefore not a little uſeful to the ſtate of Babes. This then is that which Babes attain to by believing the Reſurrection and Eternal Judgement, that they tremble at Gods Word of threatning, and <hi>work out their Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> But leſt they ſhould fear and tremble more than need, I ſhall ſpeak to them a little by way of</p>

               <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> had to do with Babes, as well as <hi>Paul</hi> (for ſuch were the Jewiſh Converts generally) and having told them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.23. that they were born again, he doth in this Text exhort them to <hi>lay aſide all malice, and all guile, and hypocriſies, and envies, and all evil ſpeaking</hi> (to which they being yet as carnal, were too prone, as was noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>and as new born Babes to deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby, if ſo be</hi> (or ſeeing and becauſe) <hi>they have taſted that the Lord is gracious.</hi> This taſting is their coming to Chriſt and believing in him as the chief corner-ſtone, <hi>v.</hi> 4.6. and their growth is their being built up on him a ſpiritual Houſe, <hi>&amp;c. Verſ.</hi> 5. which notes both the nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of theſe Babes, <hi>viz.</hi> to come to and believe in Chriſt, and withal to grow up in and to be built on him; that as he is precious or an honour to them, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. ſo they may be precious or an honour to him, and ſhew forth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues (and thereby the praiſes of him) who hath called them out of their darkneſs into his marvellous light, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:43845:84"/>
               <p> But of their Faith I have ſpoken before; I ſhall now ſpeak of ſome of their experience, which I conceive is coucht in this word of taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The perfect Chriſtian hath many ſenſes exerciſed, he is full of many and rich experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. But the Babe hath the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this one Senſe (Taſting) eſpecially: which begets in him a deſire and longing after the Word for growth, that he may ſuck and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of Conſolations, that he may milk out and be ſatisfied with the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of glory. To allude to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.11. The Babe hath a taſte as ſoon as he is born, and hath Milk given him to eat, in which he taſtes a ſweetneſs, and from which he finds ſo much nouriſhment and ſtrength as holds his ſonl in life: <hi>If he were not alive he could not taſte, and if he did not taſte, he could not live.</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is often expreſt by taſting, which is a thing beyond Hearing, and is joyn'd with See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. Oh Taſte and See that the Lord is good; Now, as Seeing, ſo Taſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the heart, and quickens the Appetite, and therefore, ſaith he, deſire the Milk; which doth not only expreſs the duty, but the nature and inclination of Babes, and that grounded on Taſting, Seeing or becauſe they have Taſted that the Lord is gracious: ſeveral experiences (as Taſtes) they have had of this. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Lord will admit them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, this is of his grace: when man had ſinned the Law was inexorable, a mans Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance could find no place there for re-acceptance though it had been ſought with tears. God
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43845:85"/>might have choſen whether he would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted man to repent; but now he hath, it favours of grace: and by this the Babes Taſte that he is gracious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They Taſte that the Lord is gracious in that he hath provided a new and living way wherein to come to him, that they may be ſaved at anothers coſt and charges: that he ſent his Son into the world to ſave ſinners, that through him they might believe in God, and that thence they might have hope in God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They Taſte grace in this, That God calls for no greater things at their hand than to eat Milk,
<note place="margin">Pro. 28.14.</note> to Repent and Believe the Goſpel, and doth not put them to do penance in Hell for thouſands of years, or do ſome extraordinary tasks of duty in this world: and weeping out their eyes, wearing out their knees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They Taſte his grace in that he not only commands, but invites and intreats them to come, to Repent and Believe that they may live; That God ſhould condeſcend ſo far as to beſeech and go a begging to them (as the word is) that they would be reconciled, gives them a Taſte that the Lord is gracious, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They Taſte it in this, That God incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth them to come by many great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2, 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28,—30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea he ſwears to them as he lives that he delights not in the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but that he ſhould return and live.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That God hath knockt ſo often and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43845:85"/>ſo long to lead them by his goodneſs, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and long ſuffering to Repentance, that though they have not anſwered unleſs it were ſurlily and ſinfully, we will not come; that though they have put his patience to it, yet that he ſhould knock and wait, this gives them a further Taſte, that the Lord is gracious.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That they have been at laſt convinced of the neceſſity of Repentance toward God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that they are come to themſelves to ſee their dead, loſt and undone condition, 'tis of grace; for who could have opened their eyes and wrought on their hearts, or would have done it but a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God? and in this they Taſte his gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. That they have been enabled (with the Prodigal) to proſecute this conviction, to ariſe and go, to repent from dead works, and to make toward God by Faith, they Taſte his grace in it, for Repentance and Faith are both the gifts of a gracious God to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1,—8.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They Taſte that the Lord is gracious in giving them a Spirit of Prayer and Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they can bow their knees and beg not only the pardon of their ſins, but the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of their Souls. In this they Taſte his grace.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They have a Taſte of his being gracious in that they are bid welcom when they come, and that not only his Saints receive them into the brotherhood and fellowſhip to be free of then company, but that now and then God
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43845:86"/>ſmiles on them too, and is pleaſed to kiſs them with the kiſſes of his mouth, and to vouchſafe them ſome fellowſhip with himſelf.</p>
               <p n="11">11. They Taſte that the Lord is gracious in that he ſits on a Throne of grace and gives them leave to come with boldneſs for more mercy and grace, for their ſeaſonable relief: and that he doth allow them ſincere Milk to grow thereby.</p>
               <p n="12">12. They Taſte his grace in this alſo, that they can diſcern the difference between their former and preſent ſtate, how deſperate and damnable that was, but how hopeful this is: that they had rather die than be dead in ſins again.</p>
               <p n="13">13. What preſent peace they have, and what ever hopes of more, even to everlaſting Conſolation, 'tis from the grace of God; and in it they Taſte that he is gracious, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome (among others) of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences that Babes have, or Taſtes of the Lords being gracious; I have not ſet them out at large, becauſe I would give you them (as they have them) <hi>viz.</hi> for Taſtes: and though they are but ſuch, yet theſe Taſtes beget de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and longings after the ſincere Milk that they may grow thereby. By this Taſte of theirs they can a little diſtinguiſh between ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and falſified Milk, between pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Milk, between good and evil doctrine, though not ſo well as grown Saints: Their car tryeth words, whether it be a form of ſound words; and their Taſte trieth milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43845:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>whether it be wholſome and nouriſhing or not, to allude to that in <hi>Job</hi> 12.11. and 34.3. and therefore though they be full of appetite and deſire, yet 'tis to ſincere milk, for they cannot thrive nor live by any other. Now though their deſires after higher attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be (at preſent) their (almoſt) high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt attainment, yet deſires are not deſpicable things, but of value. <hi>The deſire of a man is his kindneſs, and a poor man is better than a Lyar,</hi> Prov. 19.22. though they be but poor as to attainments, yet they are rich in deſires, and God takes this kindneſs kindly at their hands, that 'tis in their hearts to do greater things and to grow: this poor man is better than a Lyar, than an Hypocrite that pretends to, makes profeſſions and promiſes of great things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a real deſire and kindneſs to the things which he make a fair ſhew of in a complement and in the fleſh. If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. 'Tis not a little to be able to ſay as <hi>Nehemiab</hi> did, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.11. <hi>O'Lord, I beſeech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the Prayer of thy Servant, and to the Prayer of thy Servants who deſire to fear thy Name.</hi> And as the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Chap.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Pray for us, for we truſt that we have a good Conſcience in all things willing to live honeſtly.</hi> This Babe is a man of deſires (in both ſenſes) <hi>i. e.</hi> he is loving and beloved, he is deſiring and deſired, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8 9.2 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 7. Thus you have ſeen the Taſts and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43845:87"/>deſires of Babes to grow: which is an attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not to be undervalued by them, nor are they to be undervalued by others. For a cloſe to all their former attainments and characters I ſhall add one more, which is much taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in Scripture.</p>

               <head>VI. <hi>Their Love to the Brethren</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is but one thing more which I ſhall take notice of in relation to Babes attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that is, <hi>Their Love to the Brethren,</hi> whereby they act like members of the Body of Chriſt, whoſe office it is to have the ſame care one for another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. and not be like this world, every man for himſelf, or ſay like <hi>Cain, Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> That they do love the Brethren (in their degree fervently as well as truly) is atteſted by <hi>Peter,</hi> who writing to Babes ſaith, <hi>Seeing ye have purified your hearts in obeying the truth by the Spirit unto unfeigned Love of the Brethren, ſee that ye</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to) <hi>Love one another, with a pure heart fervently,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.22. he exhorts them to do that fully, which they already did in part, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5 11. <hi>Comfort your ſelves together, and edifie one another, as ye alſo do.</hi> 'Tis the great Character of Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that they Love one another, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. and by this they are known to have part from death to life, becauſe they love the Brethren, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15. Where give me leave to note this as to this Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> the great duty urged
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43845:87"/>in it is to love one another (ſpoken to and of all the children of God) and the ſin ſo much declaimed againſt is hating or not loving of one another: and when he ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.8. <hi>He that ſinneth is of the Devil,</hi> he meaneth this ſin in ſpecial, <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin,</hi> viz. this ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſeed of God (of whom he is born) remaineth in him (which is the ſame reaſon that is given by <hi>Peter</hi> preſſing to the ſame duty, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22, 23.) and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. he diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Children of God from them of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by this very thing: and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. inſtanceth in <hi>Cain</hi> who was of the wicked one, as he proves by his breaking this command of loving his Brother. And perhaps the ſin unto death ſpoken of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.16,—19. is meant of this ſin, for ſuch an one abideth in death, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.14. compare <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.7,—16. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.16,—19. and this ſeems to be very clear.</p>
               <p>But to proceed as to the thing in hand, <hi>viz,</hi> that Babes Love the Brethren, 'tis clearly man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by this among other things, that they are ready to miniſter to their neceſſities, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, opportunity and ability gives them leave to do. The Apoſtle boaſts of his <hi>Corinthian</hi>-Babes, that he knew the forwardneſs of their mind, and boaſted of their readineſs to this thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1, 2. and the Authour of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrew</hi>-Babes, tells them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.10. that God was not unrighteous to forget their labour of Love, which they had ſhew'd to his name, in that they had miniſtred
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43845:88"/>and did continue to miniſter to the Saints: and upon this ſcore he is perſwaded ſuch good things of them as accompanied and contained Salvation, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. of ſo great an eſteem is this grace of Love, warranted and adjuſted by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring to the Saints. And indeed 'tis the great thing for which Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father inherit the Kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you;</hi> why Lord? for I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you miniſtred to me in doing it to mine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34,—40. This labour of Love is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
               <p>I might inlarge on this Theam, but it ſhall ſuffice to have toucht it. And now that Babes may behold themſelves in this Glaſs, I ſhall ſumm up their attainments and characters briefly thus: They have the Foundation laid; they are new-born and do eat Milk in obeying the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt: they have all things neceſſary to the being of a Saint, and ſuch as accompany or contain Salvation; though not enough to a well-being here, or to have an entrance miniſtred to them abundantly in Heaven, as other Saints have: they have all conſtituting and eſſential Graces, as Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Faith, Love, though not in ſo perfect a degree as the other Claſſes have, they preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (after their manner, in deſires) to grow; though they cannot run the race, yet they walk in the way of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they preſs after to follow the other Saints though ſlowly (as the Poet ſaid of <hi>Aſcanius,—ſequitur non paſſibus aequis</hi>) and are not able to keep pace with them. This is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43845:88"/>their picture, the draught of their attainment; the particular features and lineaments whereof are deſcribed before in their reſpective places, to which I reſer you. I muſt now proceed to ſhew them their deſectiveneſs in compariſon of other Saints, and wherein they are <hi>as</hi> carnal, that I may provoke them to jealouſie and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and thereby to perfection.</p>

The character of little Children is that they know the Father, <hi>viz.</hi> to be their Father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. But the Babe-child, the Infant of (attainment as well as) daies, the ſucking Child that is ſed only with Milk, though he have a Father, and a Father that provides for him, yet he knows him not to be his Father. The generality of the Old Teſtament profeſſors were but Babes, and their uſual way of addreſs
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43845:89"/>to God was, as the God that made Heaven and Earth, <hi>the Creator;</hi> and ſometimes as the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, the Promiſer:</hi> But ſeldom, not above twice (as a collective body) addreſt to God as their Father; the places where they did ſo addreſs are <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. and 64.8. both which are rather Prophecies of what they ſhould do hereafter, than aſſertions of what they did do, as ſome conceive. And in this latter they addreſs to him as a Father, <hi>viz</hi> a maker and Soveraign, as appears by calling themſelves the clay, and God the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and telling him that they were the works of his hand. And to prevent an Objection that may be made from the Prodigal, who did at firſt addreſs to God, as his Father (I will go to <hi>my</hi> Father, and in <hi>my</hi> Fathers houſe) it might be in this ſenſe of a Creator, as in <hi>Dent.</hi> 32.6. beſide, I may ſay that he ſeems to be the repreſentative of a returning back-ſlider,

The Babe-Saints though they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in and communion with God and Chriſt, yet (while ſuch) 'tis much in the dark to to them, and they have not the aſſurance of it, as the little Children and other higher degrees of Saints have: I may ſay of theſe, as God did of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their infant age, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1, 3. <hi>When Iſrael was a Child</hi> (a Babe) <hi>I loved him, I taught Ephraim alſo to go, but they knew not that I bealed them:</hi> The Babes are rather ſaid to be known of God, than they can be ſaid to know him, as 'tis expreſt concerning them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. Babes have life, and light, and power in a meaſure; there are influences from God to them, and a ſecret converſe between God and them, which yet they apprehend and diſcern but a little.

God deſcends into them by many illapſes, they aſcend to God by many breathings, yet they are not ſure, they know not whether this be God that come down, or grace that goes up. The beſt ſee but darkly and through a glaſs, but in part in compariſon of what viſion is to be; but theſe ſee more darkly than the others that ſee but darkly, and know leſs than they that know but in part: being Babes they underſtand as Babes, for ſo that is which we render Child, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. Now though there be more than a <hi>Potentia,</hi> ſome Acts, yet they have ſo little underſtanding, that 'tis inſignificant in compariſon of men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. They ſee as the poor man did at firſt in a conſuſed way, men as Trees, yet
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43845:90"/>walking, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.24. when other Saints ſee them as they are, men clearly; as that man did after the ſecond touch of Chriſts hand, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. Theſe poor Babes act grace, but can hardly ſay 'tis grace: they walk and follow, as <hi>Peter</hi> did the Angel out of Priſon, but wiſt not that it was true, which was done unto him, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.9. They hear God and anſwer to his call as little <hi>Samuel</hi> did, but as yet he knew not the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.7. They have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to more things, than they have attained to the knowledge of, which is the advance of other Saints. Their eyes are held in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as the Diſciples were, that though Jeſus draw near and talk with them, yet they know him not, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.15, 16. he tells them this and the other thing, and they feel its working, but know not what to make of it, and are afraid to ask him, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.45. Many ſaw and talkt with Jeſus, yet took him for the Gardiner, and knew him not till a while after, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.14,—17. So 'tis with theſe poor ſouls, though God know them, and work in them, and talk to them, yet what he is doing, they know not yet, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, Joh.</hi> 13.7. if they be in the Mount and ſee any glory, they are more afraid than tranſported, and ſay, <hi>It is good to be here,</hi> and yet know not what they ſay, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.33. While Chriſt talks to them their hearts burn within them, ſome heat and warmings they feel, but they know him not, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.16,—32. they are troubled, and thoughts ariſe in their hearts, though he ſay, <hi>Peace be to you, Verſ.</hi> 36, 37.

               <p>Indeed, 'tis as hard a thing to live out of our ſelves and fetch all from another, to ſay as <hi>Paul, It is not I that live, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> as 'tis not to live to our ſelves but to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Babes act and ſpeak as if they lived en their own ſtock, and boaſt too often as if they had not received, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. This principle of deriving all ſanctification from Chriſt is not preſently and diſtinctly known to all believers; 'tis probable that the Diſciples underſtood it not, till Chriſt taught it them in that Sermon, <hi>John</hi> 15. and this indeed is the caſe of Babes, for though to

'Tis like <hi>Saul</hi>'s Armour to <hi>David,</hi> too heavy for him, he hath not been uſed to it, nor tryed it, and therefore cannot bear it, he muſt to his Sling or can do no feats. They are not yet ſo ſtrong to put on all the Armour of God, they cannot weild the Sword of the Spirit, nor uſe the Shield of Faith dextrouſly.

Many a young Student takes a great deal of pains, is ever reading, but is not Maſter of what he reads; and the fault is not ſo much in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or the Will, as in the underſtanding: ſo 'tis with theſe Babes, they hear and read much, but cannot digeſt and concoct it; no, though they remember it: but ſtrong men love to make their meals of ſtrong meat, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. Again,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Babes are defective in this that they have not attained to uſe or an habit as they of full age (or the perfect) have: as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as there is between habit and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo much there is between Babes and grown Saints, for ſo the diſtinction is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. Habits are full of skill and ſtrength and make operation eaſie, whereas diſpoſitions are faint and weak, meer eſſays and attempts, ſuch as are in Babes to ſpeak and go. They have not (like <hi>David</hi> as to his Armour) been uſed nor habited to ſuch things, and cannot go nor walk in them as others can that have try'd again and again: we eaſily do things we have been uſed or wont to do, but we are bunglers at things for want of uſe and habit, which is the caſe of Babes; ſo that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe and grown Saints, is as much as between manhood and infancy, the ſtrength and weakneſs of the one and other, as between an

               <p n="5">5. Babes are defective in this, that they have not the ſenſes exerciſed (the taſte they have (as before) but not all the ſenſes exerciſed) to diſcern both good and evil. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. that which ſtrong men have, Babes want, <hi>viz.</hi> diſcerning faculties, and an ability to diſtinguiſh things that differ, that they may approve of the things which are moſt excellent, as <hi>Paul</hi> prayed that the <hi>Philippians</hi> might be able to do (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.10. compared with the Margent) and not only hold faſt that which is good. For want of this skill of diſcerning.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Babes are apt to be toſſed to and fro with every (fair) wind of Doctrine, and to be abuſed by crafty mates and falſe teachers, that can make and fit as well as feign words on purpoſe: this is hinted in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. <hi>That we henceforth be no more Children</hi> (gr.

And again tells them his fears of them leſt as the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> (in her infancy) through his ſubtlety, ſo their minds ſhould be corrupted (by falſe teachers) from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1,—5.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43845:95"/>and again, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12,—15. ſo the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (the Babe Chriſtian Jews in <hi>Judea</hi>) were in great danger of being turned aſide by falſe teachers, which occaſioned that Epiſtle to them: and the Jews diſperſed alſo were in the like danger, as appears by a <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1,—3. and 3.17, and the <hi>Galatians</hi> alſo, as is evident from <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.6,—9. and the ſcope of the whole Epiſtle, but the little Children are more fixed and firm, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.18,—27.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Babes defectiveneſs is ſeen in this, that they ſerve God rather after the manner of Servants, than as Children: they are (as the Prodigal did at firſt wiſh to be) as hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. This is clear from <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. the Heir, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. as long as he is a Child (<hi>gr.</hi> a Babe) differeth nothing from a Servant, but is, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. under Tutors and Governours (a Schoolmaſter, the Law, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.24.) and while they are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (<hi>gr.</hi> Babes) are in bondage under the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or rudiments of the world, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. which be calls beggarly, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. and tells them 'tis (though they deſire it) to be in bondage, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. and oppoſeth the Son and Servant, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6.

               <p>The occaſion not given but taken was from <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> who planted and watered them; from hence they grow into more than emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for they were envious for their ſakes (as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was for <hi>Moſes</hi>) and puſſed up for one againſt another, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.6. one was for <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:43845:96"/>and another for <hi>Apollo,</hi> as being of them, and this was their carnality, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. but wherein lay this carnality? were they more carnal in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am one of <hi>Pauls</hi> Children, or one of <hi>Pauls</hi> Hearers, than <hi>Paul</hi> in calling himſelf their Father and Teacher? ſurely no, the carnality lay not in this. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> his Sons, and faith of theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 4.14, 15. that they were his Sons, that he had begotten them, that they were of him; and therefore in that relative, reſpective and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling ſenſe they might without carnality call him Father, and ſay they were of him. But the carnality lay in ſuch things as theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were more taken with the gifts and parts of either of theſe than with their office and graces: men have (as I may ſay) ſeveral humours, and they are moſt taken with that man, that takes and toucheth their humour moſt: Some that were for down-right plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs took <hi>Paul</hi>'s part; others that were of a more nice and tickliſh humour were taken with <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Eloquence: for <hi>Paul</hi> came not with Oratory, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1,—4. but with plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. And <hi>Apollo</hi> was an Elequent man, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.24. In this they were Babes and as carnal; for whereas they ſhould have no mans perſon or parts in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but honour the man of God for the works ſake, they ſeemed to honour each for their words ſake, and not for Gods Word ſake, which came unto them. And alas! how many ſuch Babes are there among us alſo Some are
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43845:97"/>all for a bold Preacher (that comes with down-right blows) for a plain man without welt or guard as we ſay: and others are more fine and curious, they muſt have the Diſh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,

               <p n="2">2. Theſe Babes, and as carnal <hi>Corinthians</hi> did it ſeems much confine, not only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeives but God too, to ſuch a mans Miniſtry: they lookt for no increaſe (ſome of them) unleſs <hi>Paul</hi> did Preach, nor others unleſs <hi>Apollo</hi> did Preach; as if their Faith and the bleſſing had come from the man, as is intimated in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6.7. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.13, 14. if <hi>Paul</hi> Baptized, Preacht and adminiſtred the Lords Feaſt or Supper, then they promiſed themſelves great matters, as others did from <hi>Apollo;</hi> as if the ſucceſs had been from men and not from God. Poor Babes! that will let none feed them but ſuch a Nurſe, or ſuch a Servant, as if the Milk would do them moſt good when this or that perſon puts it into their mouth. How many of theſe are there to this day, that care not to hear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch a man Preach; tuſh, ſay they, this is not the man I came to hear, and away they go. My heart will never be beaten down and broken, ſaith one, unleſs <hi>Paul</hi> Preach; nor mine quickened and raiſed up, ſaith another, unleſs <hi>Apollo</hi> Preach. They are more taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ith man than God, and mans word than Gods too too often: when we muſt know that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43845:97"/>if any work be wrought 'tis the Lords doing, and he alone ſhould be wonderful in our eyes: who ever brings a mercy 'tis God ſends and bleſſeth it, and the glory ſhould be his. Theſe Babes receive a man, that they affect, as an Angel of God, yea as Chriſt Jeſus, and bleſs him too, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15. and it may be after awhile another ſteals away their hearts (for they are giddy, and unſtable many of them) and then <hi>Apollo</hi> is beyond <hi>Paul,</hi> and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their enemy for telling them the truth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. and they exclude him for another, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. Thus as if the men were all in all, as they affect, do they celebrate and admire; as if not Chriſt but <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi> had been cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for them, or were divided, the Apoſtle upbraids them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12, 13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Babes were yet ſo carnal that ſome truth would ſcarce be believed by them unleſs it came out of <hi>Paul</hi>'s mouth, nor by others unleſs it came from <hi>Apollo</hi>'s: they embraced the truth for the mans ſake, more than the man for the truths ſake; and the feet were more beautiful than the tydings, or elſe the tydings were not beautiful, if ſuch a mans feet did not bring them. If <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid it was an Oracle, his (<hi>ipſe dixit</hi>) word was ſufficient to ſome, who would ſcarce believe it from <hi>Apollo;</hi> and others that were for <hi>Apollo</hi> preferred it much beyond what they would have done if <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid it: 'tis to them as if 'twere another thing, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel, another Chriſt, another Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. And as it was then is it not now? ſome truths will not down with ſome perſons
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43845:98"/>unleſs it come from ſuch a man, as if he made it more and another leſs true than it was; whereas the truth is the ſame whether in <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollo</hi>'s mouth; and not at all the more or leſs true for this or that mans ſaying it. If ſuch a man or party of men ſay ſo, we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, ſay many Babes. This or that man is their Oracle, if he ſay it, it muſt be true; if he do not ſay it, eſpecially if he gainſay it, it cannot be true.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They were yet ſo carnal that they fell into parties, and took ſides, and thence came en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying and ſtrife, faction and confuſion; they brake out into vilifying of one another, they grew proud and quarrelſome, and could ſcarce live in love and peace together. We ſay <hi>Paul</hi> is the beſt Preacher, he Preacheth ſtrongly, ſay the Pauliniſts; and ſay the Apollonians, <hi>Apallo</hi> is the beſt Preacher, he Preacheth fluently: and they can ſcarce forbear fighting, and crying out, Who is on our ſide? who? and wo and alas, is not this fulfilled in our ears in our daies! Who would think that Babes ſhould make ſo much a do? but the queſtion reſolves it ſelf, the Babes are carnal; and whence comes fighting and war but from the luſts of the fleſh? <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1. Oh that I might by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty prevail that theſe Babiſh and carnal tricks may be laid aſide: it ſhall be granted to you that God may uſe one man more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for bringing in and building up; but ſtill remember that the excellency of the power is of God and not of the Earthen Veſſel. It ſhall be granted that thou maiſt love, if thou
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43845:98"/>wilt not Idolize thy Father <hi>Paul,</hi> not call him Father as the Jews did the Phariſees. It may be <hi>Boanerges</hi> may ſuit one and <hi>Barnabas</hi> another better; but remember, it muſt not be judged by humour. Hear thine <hi>Apollo,</hi> but receive the Word not as his but as Gods, or elſe 'twill not work effectually, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. do not call him thy <hi>(magnus Apollo)</hi> thine Oracle. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth who ever Preach it, <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> but do not pin thy Faith on any mans ſleeve, be it white or black: be of what Church thou wilt, ſo thou be of the Church of Chriſt, and do not glory in this, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and I of <hi>Apollo;</hi> for there is no Church in Scripture called this mans or that mans, 'tis the Church of God, and the Churches of Chriſt. I could ſay other things, but I intend to ſpare you all I can, though there are many more carnalities yet to be mentioned; <hi>pudetque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were <hi>as</hi> carnal in that they were proud of being in Church communion, though they had and kept communion with very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſons (and their lump was leavened) That they did ſo is clear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and yet were puſſed up, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. and gloried, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. they boaſted of being in fellowſhip, though it were with groſs and unheard of ſinners, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. which puts the Apoille upon ſuch Exhortations as we find in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14,—When perſons can content themſelves with and be proud of ſuch common, prophane (and therefore fulſome and offenſive) communion at large, 'tis an argument of their being <hi>as</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43845:99"/>when content with Ordinances diſorderly adminiſtred, they are as carnal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17,—34. when humane partitions ſteal the name of a Church, and mixt participations the name of communion, and Chriſtians can pleaſe themſelves with and glory in it, they are <hi>as</hi> carnal. Be not therefore unequally yoked; and if any that is called Brother be a Fornicator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſuch an one don't you eat.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That theſe <hi>Corinthian</hi>-Babes were <hi>as</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appears by their going to Law with one another before the unbelievers and unjuſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1,—8. this they were bold and daring in, <hi>durſt any of you?</hi> Verſ. 1. this they did for toyes and trifles, the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> matters, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. they had cauſe to be aſhamed of it, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. as if there had not been one wiſe or honeſt man among them; 'twas utterly and undeniably a fault, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. And yet being but Babes and <hi>as</hi> carnal, this they durſt to do. Such Babes are all they who do after this faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo is every one, ſuch another piece of carnality, who refuſeth the hearing of the Saints, and goes to Law with his Brother before unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and the unjuſt. The Apoſtle ſpeaks anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this caſe, <hi>What? dare you? know ye not,</hi> &amp;c. Can you profeſs and pray? and yet not forgive, nor ſuffer, but wrong and defraud, and that your Brethren! Oh what a ſtrange thing is this, it cannot be excuſed nor any plea can be made for it, 'tis utterly a fault ('tis altogether and wholly a fault, as the <hi>gr.</hi>) 'tis baſe all over!</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:43845:99"/> 4. Babes appear to be <hi>as</hi> carnal in this, that they paſs from one extream to another in their actings, and are not acquainted with the golden mean and moderation: they either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or over do. A while theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were ſo careleſs that they did not mind to caſt out or cenſure the inceſtuous perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and anon they are ſo violent, that they will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, but ſuffer him to be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. Thus they go from the extream of deſect, to that of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and are not acquainted with the divine mediocrity to walk in the midſt of the paths of Judgement. So the <hi>Galatian</hi> Babes, at the firſt they admire <hi>Paul,</hi> and bleſs him, but after a while, they carry it to him as if he had been their enemy, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14,—16. and this was ſoon done, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.6. At the beginning, who but <hi>Paul,</hi> they were ready to Deify him; after a while, he was no body, they were ready to defie him: thus do they, not veeze about by degrees, but chop about from one extream to another, being toſſed with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. they ſail with that wind that blows, and are carried with the laſt man they heard, poor weather-cocks that they are.</p>
               <p>When our Saviour began to waſh the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples feet, <hi>John</hi> 13. ſaies <hi>Peter,</hi> Verſ. 6. <hi>Lord, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43845:100"/>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Lord, not only my feet, but my hands and my head.</hi> The one extream was, thou ſhalt not, never waſh my feet; and the other extream is, waſh my head: he paſſeth from one extream to another in a moment as 'twere. In matter of practice the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were in the extream; one while not caſt out, another not take in the inceſtuous perſon: in point to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the <hi>Galatians</hi> would now pull out their eyes for <hi>Paul,</hi> and then pull out his eyes: and as for proteſtation, <hi>Peter</hi> is one time for not at all, and by and by for all over: this is the way of theſe Babes, and this their way is their folly, for they are <hi>as</hi> carnal.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are <hi>as</hi> carnal in this, that they take great exceptions at a little matter, they will take pet at nothing almoſt. If you be not of their way and follow them, they will take it ill even to the forbidding of doing Chriſts work, as the Diſciples did, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.38. but they were <hi>as</hi> carnal in this, and therefore Chriſt forbids them to do any ſuch thing, and on weighty reaſons too, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 39, 40. Babes in Chriſt are many of them of a touchy, peeviſh and ſowr humour. So when the Diſciples met with colder entertainment than they lookt for, they were for fire from Heaven, which was an evident ſign that they knew not what ſpirit they were of, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.51,—55. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had made a promiſe to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of coming to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.5,—7. and was diſappointed, they preſently accuſe him of lightneſs and complement, which puts him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Apologiſing for himſelf; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.15,—24.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43845:100"/>and ſurely they are as babiſh as theſe were, that are ſo raſh and cenſorious, that take pet and make exception without cauſe: they are <hi>as</hi> carnal.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Babes are <hi>as</hi> carnal in making many queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either trivial or needleſs ones; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves much about things of little concernment to their edification. Under the notion of a caſe or ſcruple of Conſcience they will ask many an impertinent queſtion. The way of asking queſtions may be of great uſe, <hi>Qui dubitat, qui ſaepe rogat,</hi> &amp;c. but carnal men as the Phariſees and Sadducees were, askt Chriſt many a captious and quarrelſome queſtion; yea the Devil abuſed our common Mother by a Quaerie: and in this the Babes are <hi>as</hi> carnal that they take up a great deal of time and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about impertinent and little things. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> troubled <hi>Paul</hi> about ſuch things as common diſcretion would have determined, and therefore he tells them ſo often in relation to it, thus ſay I, not the Lord, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.6. and 12. and 25, 26. and 40.) as much as to ſay, theſe things are not ſo much matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Conſcience, as of prudence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. As about Marrying, ſo about eating they ſeemed to be very ſolicitous and much concerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. which yet was an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. only ſuch liberty muſt not be abuſed to the offence of others, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. elſe 'tis not a matter of Conſcience whether I may eat or not, this or that, for any thing that is ſold in the Shambles and good for food is lawful to be eaten without a diſpute, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43845:101"/>27,—33. ſo the Diſciples till Chriſts Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were full of pitiful queſtions, who ſhall be greateſt? <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.1. what ſhall this man do? <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.21. <hi>Wilt thou at this time reſtore the Kingdom to Iſrael?</hi> Acts 1.6. Alas! what a poor low way of queſtioning is this? indeed to ask, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> what is the Will of God concerning me in my place and relation? how ſhall I attain to a more perfect ſtate? ſuch things are conſiderable and worth the asking: but to be taken up about little and low things, is to be as Babes, and as carnal; <hi>more nice than wiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Theſe Babes live much more by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the example of men, than by rule or reaſon. They are as to their Faith a kind of implicite believers, and believe as the Church, or ſuch and ſuch a great wiſe and learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor believes: and their practice is a kind of imitation of ſome men in ſuch and ſuch things. This made <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak to his <hi>Corinthians</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him but as he followed Chriſt, if you will follow and have an example of me, look on me only as in, and walking in the ſteps of Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1,—3. I fear that to this day many perſons take into ſuch a track, becauſe ſuch and ſuch men (whom they affect) do ſo, more than for any conviction that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, or any account they can give that it is the way of God. But remember, <hi>Non quâitur, ſed quâ cundum eſt,</hi> we ſhould not walk by what is done, but by what ought to be done, <hi>Morth.</hi> 19.1,—9.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They are <hi>as</hi> carnal in having more zeal
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43845:101"/>than knowledge to manage it: of the Jews the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2, 3. and in like manner doth he ſpeak of the <hi>Galatian</hi>-Babes, and upon the like occaſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.16,—21. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1,—5. They no ſooner get a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the end, but they are all of a flame; they (like tinder) take fire preſently, and ſuffer zeal (though without diſcretion) to eat them up. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, while carnal, was a moſt zealous man, but 'twas in the daies of his ignorance. Zeal (like fire) is a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent indeed, but 'tis a bad Maſter, it need be well watch'd. When the Diſciples in their zeal would have called for fire from Heaven, 'twas from their unacquaintedneſs with their own ſpirit. And 'twas in ſuch a fit that <hi>Peter</hi> drew his Sword. But this is not the way of Chriſt, whoſe Kingdom is not of this world, and therefore will not that his ſervants fight, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.51. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.10. and 36. 'tis like carnal men to think we do God good ſervice by killing them that do not deſerve it, as being not of our way, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2. and uſually this zeal of ſuch men ſhews it ſelf moſt in the preſence of their leaders and dies in their abſence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.2. I will not undertake to tell who are, and how many ſuch Babes there are in our daies, but I am afraid there are too many.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Babes are <hi>as</hi> carnal in this that they can hardly bear a reproof or an Exhortation: car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men, and Babes that are <hi>as</hi> carnal look on reproofs as reproaches and cannot bear them. They are not without heart riſings and grudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43845:102"/>againſt them that reprove them; the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were nettled at <hi>Paul</hi>'s dealing roundly with, and rebuking them ſharply that they might be found in the Faith: they could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear with him, but almoſt called him fool for his kindneſs and love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. and 12.11,—15. the Author of the Epiſtile to the <hi>Hebrew</hi>-Babes is fain to entreat them to <hi>ſuffer</hi> a word of Exhortation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.22. <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, ſuffer the word of exher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for I have written a Letter to you in few words.</hi> Though one ſpeak but a little, but a few words, they think them too many, if they like not what is ſaid, though perhaps it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns none ſo much as themſelves. <hi>Eli</hi>'s carnal Sons could not bear reproof from their Father; nor can Babes <hi>as</hi> carnal bear any though from a Father. And beſide this, they are loth to ſuffer for Religion, but will rather comply and conform with &amp; to the rudiments of this world, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> with Jewiſh, and the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> with Gentile Rites rather than ſuffer perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. 'Tis true the <hi>Hebrews</hi> after they were illuminated, indured a great fight of affliction at firſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32. but they had weak hands and feeble knees, and began to faint and be weary, which occaſioned that quickening ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. which he intreats them to ſuffer, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.22. The Diſciples themſelves were ſcattered and fled at the ſmiting of the Shepherd, ſo tedious a thing is ſuffering to them that are but Babes, and <hi>as</hi> carnal. If thou ſaint in the day of affliction, thy ſtrength is ſmall, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.10.</p>

To name no more, ſome of them are apt to meaſure Gods heart by his hand, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men do love and hatred by the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, which is a falſe rule. If Gods hand be open to and fill them with his bleſſings, then all is well; but if his hand be ſhut up from, or laid upon them, then (like <hi>Sion</hi> of old) God hath forſaken them: this is their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the beſt of this world is not good enough to be a Love token, nor the worſt of it bad enough to be a token of hatred. If God ſlay their Son, or take away what they love, they draw ſad concluſions, as if God had no reſpect for them: ſo it ſeems the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were apt to do, when God afflicted them, and therefore the Apoſtle tells them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. when we are Judged (though for this cauſe, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 30.) yet we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. And ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi>-Babes were heartned by the like conſideration that they might not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Gods heart by his hand, nor his promiſes and love by his providential diſpenſations, but that he dealt with them as Sons ,<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5,—13.</p>
               <p>Theſe (ſeeing I have promiſed to name no more) are the things (too many) wherein the Babes are as carnal; and ſo, as no other degree of Saints are, at leaſt in ſuch a degree as they are.

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y way of Examination, that we may Catechiſe our ſelves and learn to know, 1. Whether we are Babes or no, whether new-born or not: and this we have great reaſon to do, becauſe not only our hearts are deceitful and may abuſe us by making us think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of our ſelves than we are, and therefore 'tis fooliſh to truſt our hearts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.26. But becauſe many have been actually cozened, as the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many have thought themſelves rich who have been poor, and others have thought themſelves poor who have been rich, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.7. of which former the Angel of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is an inſtance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. and of the latter the Angel of <hi>Smyrna, Rev.</hi> 2.9. that therefore we may paſs a right judgement on, let us examine, our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>In relation hereunto 'tis but neceſſary that I premiſe ſome things about Converſion for the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43845:104"/>preventing of Objections, the removing of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and ſo for the clearing of the way which leads us to know whether we are new-born, converted or not. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the new-birth is a myſterie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is a ſecret thing, a work that begins within, out of ſight; it puzzled <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Maſter, a Rabby in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to think what kind of thing regeneration ſhould be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3,—13. Though there be motions and viſible turnings (as in the wheels of a Watch) yet the ſpring is within and hidden. How the Child is faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Womb is a great myſterie; but the formings of the new-birth is a greater: for 'tis a work wholly and altogether of God; making, and 'tis curiouſly wrought in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places of the heart, 'Tis a being renewed in the ſpirit of the mind (which is the prime and proper ſeat of it) <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23. Now the work being ſo inward, ſecret and hidden, 'tis hard to trace Gods footſteps, and to ſearch mans heart: all the waies of God are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable enough, but eſpecially theſe in the great deep, as mans heart is called. <hi>The way of a Serpent on a Rock, the way of a Ship in the Sea, and of a Bird in the Air cannot be found out,</hi> much leſs can this way of God, unleſs he reveal it by his Spirit, which works it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10,—12. Though the outſide of the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs may be diſcerned, yet the inwards of it are like the white name which none knows but he (I, and perhaps not every he) that hath it. There are but few can give an exact
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43845:104"/>and full relation and ſtory of this thing; 'tis ſo ſecret that many things paſs by undiſcerned: as who knows the errours, ſo who knows the true workings of his heart? 'tis the hidden man of the heart, and the heart is hidden from the man. If men underſtand but little of earthly things, which are their element, and whereof they profeſs themſelves maſters, how much leſs do they know ſuch a ſpiritual and heavenly thing as this, as our Saviour told <hi>Nicodemus, Joh.</hi> 3.7,—12. experience is the beſt School-Miſtriſs in this caſe, of which I ſhall ſpeak anon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I premiſe this that God takes various oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to convert men, and uſeth various means to bring about this work: which I mention becauſe ſome are apt to think they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, if it be not done in the ſame way as it hath with others. The firſt and moſt uſual is the Preaching of the Goſpel, for Faith cometh by hearing (one way or other) <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.—17. Sometimes God takes occaſion from reading to ſend a Preacher, as to the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which way ſoever the Word attend upon us to ſave us, let us attend upon the ſaving Word: give thy ſelf to Reading and to Hearing, and who knows but God may give thee Faith whilſt thou art Reading or Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? if he have not done it for thee that way already. Sometime God takes occaſion to do it at a conference or a diſcourſe, as it was at that between Chriſt and the woman of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 4. Sometime God doth make uſe of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiction and a low-brought condition, as he
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43845:105"/>did to convert the Prodigal; and <hi>David</hi> found this of uſe for a reconverſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.67. and 71. Sometime he takes an occaſion from ſome mercy he hath ſhewn and deliverance which he hath wrought for a perſon, and ſo obliged and led him to Repentance by his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: ſuch a thing was the occaſion of the blind mans converſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. and of one of the Lepers, and perhaps of the Jaylor. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time God takes occaſion by a dream to do it, <hi>Job</hi> 33.14,—30. Sometime from a mans curioſity, as he did <hi>Zacheus, Luk.</hi> 19. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have gone to ſee and be ſeen, or to hear words as a lovely Song (as <hi>Auſtine</hi> did <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) have been met with, and have felt a work. When they went to hear <hi>Paul</hi> for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.19. yet then ſome believed, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 34. Yea, ſometime he ſtays till men be in a full careere of ſinning and then meets with them as he did with <hi>Saul, Acts</hi> 9. but ſuch caſes are not ordinary. Sometime God makes uſe of the good converſation of others; when men will not hear the good Word of God, yet the good works (though of women) may tend to and be made uſe of for their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 2. Oh that there were more ſuch Preachers and Preaching, for then perhaps there would be more converſion. Sometime God makes uſe of the patient ſufferings of his Saints, as he did that of Chriſt to convince one and another at the time of his paſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.54. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.39,—43. and in after Ages God bleſt it ſo much that it became a Proverbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſpeech, <hi>Sanguis martyrum ſemen Eccleſiae,</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:43845:105"/>the blood of innocent and patient Martyrs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſeed of the Church.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for though he tie us to means, he hath not tied himſelf, but haply works on many ſo indiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably that they ſcarce know what was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion taken or means uſed to do it: he waits to be gracious for he is a God of Judgement, he acts judiciouſly and takes what occaſions and means he pleaſeth, he beſt knows what will beſt take. If the work be done it ſhould not be a matter of doubt to us which way it be done or by what means; yet ſeeing the Word Preacht is the moſt uſual, we ſhould wait and watch at the door of hope, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34. and 'tis a great obligation upon all Chriſtians to diſcourſe and walk holily, and to ſuffer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently as Chriſt did, ſeeing God may make uſe of their graces to make others gracious, to convince and convert men, that they ſhall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and ſay God is in them of a truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. 'tis a great mercy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be inſtrumental to the converſion of others, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the occaſions and means, ſo the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working is various and different; ſome he draws, others he drives in: Promiſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with ſome, and threatnings with others: <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>anerges</hi> works on this, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> on that. Terrours affect ſome moſt, but Love others. One is broken, another is melted. S me he keeps long under the pangs of the new-birth, and they have hard labour of it, others have a more quick delivery. Some pay but a little
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43845:106"/>fine, but a great deal of rent annually; and others pay a greater fine and leſs rent. Many ſuch things are with him, theſe are but ſome of his wares; who can tell all the waies that God takes with man, to turn back his ſoul from the pit? Some he leads on by degrees, others ſtart up on a ſudden, and are men almoſt as ſoon as they are born, as <hi>Paul</hi> was. He frowns and ſmiles, ſpeaks thunders or a ſtill voice, diſmal or joyful ſounds, as pleaſeth him; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bloweth where and how it liſteth, ſometime the bluſtering North, at other times a benigne South wind blows; ſometime there falls much rain, other times but a little dew, but all ſhall proſper. It coſt <hi>Paul</hi> and the Jaylor dear for the time, but 'twas ſoon over; as to <hi>Matthew</hi> and others, 'twas but follow me, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low immediately.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As the means and manner, ſo the time of converſion is various; There are no certain ſet times, as not before or after ſuch a year; but God calleth at any hour of the day, at it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him good: ſome ſooner and ſome later, as he did labourers into the Vineyard, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.1,—7. ſome are called when young, others when old; the Thief was called at the laſt gaſp as 'twere: 'twas one that none might deſpair, and but one that none might preſume.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Converſion is more felt by ſome than others, and the converſion of ſome is more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſignal than that of other men: ſome can tell the time and manner as well as means of their converſion, but others cannot do ſo: <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, Saul</hi> and the Jaylor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could tell the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43845:106"/>whole ſtory with all circumſtances, but <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> (in likelihood) could not do ſo, having been good (as I may ſay) time out of mind, from the very Cradle. Some know the day of conception, the moment of quickening, and can give account of the Babes ſtirring in their Womb, from time to time; when others take it for granted, or hope it upon ſome general apprehenſions only that they are with Child. Now perſons may be conſidered either as not having heard the Goſpel (as the Gentiles at firſt) or as having been notorious ſinners as <hi>Saul</hi> and the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> &amp;c. and theſe can better tell the time and manner of their converſion; but others that have lived under the Goſpel many years, or have had the advantage of better education and more civil lives, cannot give ſo exact account of the change in them; though it may be as true in theſe as the other, yet 'tis not ſo viſible and diſcernable. A little Sugar will ſweeten Wine, when a great deal muſt go to ſweeten Vinegar: and therefore uſually well bred and good diſpoſitioned perſons are more doubtful of their converſion, than others that have had ſo great a change made as to become clean contrary to themſelves. But,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Though converſion be a myſterie and wrought thus variouſly, yet ſtill 'tis a converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore is more or leſs knowable; 'tis a being tranſlated from darkneſs to light, from death to life, from the power of Satan unto God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this cannot be done without making ſome conſiderable alteration in the perſons, and working ſuch good in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43845:107"/>beſt, as was not there before: and though the time of converſion may not be known, yet that the perſon is converted may be known. There are ſome things, which the moſt refined nature if not renewed cannot do; ſome things which are proper to all convers and only to ſuch, as to be new creatures, new-born, things which nature cannot ape: grace is an element above nature, and nature at the higheſt cannot riſe ſo high as grace at the loweſt: 'tis not ſhew and appearance but reality that makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Braſs though gilded over is no Gold, nature though reformed is not grace: a Dog may vomit, a Sow may be waſhed, but they retain the nature ſtill; but grace makes a new man, a new nature.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion then is by what <hi>Criterìa</hi> or characters it may be known that a perſon is new-born? I ſhall not Anſwer only by their eating of Milk, of which before: but I ſhall lay down ſome things which are found in all true converts, and ſuch as which the beſt nature (with all the advantages of education) never reacht unto, nor can attain: to which the loweſt as well as the higheſt Chriſtian may ſet their ſeal that have known the grace of God in truth. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They deſire heartily and ſincerely not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God may be their God, but that they may be his people: and wiſh as heartily that they may have a child-like love to him, as that he may have a Fatherly love to them. They are as willing to be his to ſerve him, as that he ſhould be theirs to ſave them. They take Chriſt Jeſus not as a Phyſitian to make uſe of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43845:107"/>him in a caſe of neceſſity, but as a Husband to love and live with him: and not only as a Saviour, but as a Prince to rule and a Prophet to teach them. They implicitely take whole Chriſt in all his offices, and not divided. And who but a new-born Soul doth? The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man (eſpecially if aſſiſted by the common principles and grace of the Goſpel) deſires to be happy; and in relation thereunto may wiſh God to be his God by way of priviledge; but then he fails as to the other part of being equally deſirous to be Gods by way of duty; which every Saint doth do in its meaſure: yea, though they have not yet attained the witneſs and ſeal of the Spirit that they are the Children of God. The leaſt Saint feels the work, though it (if I may ſo ſpeak) have not yet heard the voice of the Spirit bearing witneſs thereunto, and is thereby in a ſure ſtate, though it have not the aſſurance of it: for 'tis beyond nature at higheſt, with all its attainments, to deſire and endeavour to ſerve God as well as to be ſaved by him; to be like him as to be lik'd of him; to be conformable to him, as to have Salvation from him; to obey commands as to enjoy promiſes and priviledges; to be holy, as to be happy; to have grace to glorifie God, as well as to be glorified thereby; to be in Jeſus Chriſt, not only that there may be no condemnation, but a new creation; and to be ſanctified as to be juſtified and ſaved; to live as well as to die the death of the righteous.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. New-born ones have the Law of God in and written in their hearts, and from this as
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43845:108"/>from the living principle they act, and bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſs. When the Law of God is in our hearts, our hearts will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> heart Gods Law is: others may do ſome righteous Acts, but theſe do it as their proper fruit ſpringing from the root of the matter (the Law of God and his truth) in them; and ſo 'tis an evidence of their new-birth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. every one <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is a righteouſneſs-maker (as his Trade) as ſome are called ſin-makers in oppoſition to theſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7,—10.) every one that doth ſo do righteouſneſs (in obedience to God whoſe Law is in his heart) is born of God. Now this is ſaid of the very <hi>Corinthian</hi>-Babes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. ye are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone, but in the fleſhly Table of the heart. This cannot be ſaid of any but new-born ones, and may be ſaid of them that are but newly born, even Babes in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>From this Law written in their heart, there follow and flow forth deſires and endeavours after growth, and ſuch as will not permit theſe ſouls to be ſatisfied, unleſs they attain it. I ſay it begets deſires after growth, ſuch as was clear'd before to be in Babes, from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. For having taſted that the Lord is gracious and taken into their hearts what they have taſted,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43845:108"/>they cannot but deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word of Grace to grow thereby. They deſire not only to live, but to thrive and to be lively. And though theſe Babes do not know or ſee that they grow according to their deſire, yet they know that they do deſire to grow, and that they would, as be planted in the houſe, ſo flouriſh in the Courts of the Lord, and not be trees without fruit. 'Tis much to be fear'd that they have no grace who do not deſire to grow in grace; and whether they have grace enough to be ſaved, who can be content with only ſo much grace as will ſave them.</p>
                  <p>Again, they do not only wiſh and deſire, but do indeavour alſo to attain their wiſhes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, <hi>viz.</hi> that they may grow; and do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diligently and conſcientiouſly attend upon and uſe all means that God hath appointed for their growth. Naked velleities and idle wiſhes may be found in formaliſts and hypocrites, but to be as indeavourous as deſirous is congruous to and only found in the new creatures, the new-born ones. <hi>Balaam</hi> could profeſs and wiſh like a godly man, but he inſtead of uſing anſwerable endeavours, practiſed the clean contrary: in formaliſts the end only is deſirable, but in true Saints the means are as deſirable, being not only the way to, but a part of their happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Yet once more, True Converts (though but Babes) take not up and reſt ſatisfied with deſires and endeavours, unleſs they attain the end of deſires and endeavours; or with the uſe of means without the end of means; now it's true theſe Babes attain but little, and that's the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43845:109"/>reaſon they are ſo reſtleſs and unſatisfied. They have the leaſt ſatisfaction of any Saints, becauſe they are much in deſire and little in injoyment, and therefore deſire the more. Others take up with deſires and endeavours, which theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, they proſecute and purſue ſtill, and ſay as <hi>Abſolom, Why am I come up from Geſhur, if I may not ſee the Kings face?</hi> Hearing, Praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not a ſatisfaction to them (though they do it as a duty) unleſs they have communion with and conformity to God, eekt out and carryed on thereby: and all this is becauſe the Law of God is written in their hearts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. New-born ones are for the having their ſin to be taken away, and that not only by pardoning but by purging, yea though their ſorrows ſhould continue. If God ſhould ſay to ſuch a Soul, I will take away all thy ſorrows, and make thee a chearful heart, thou ſhalt have Corn, and Wine, and Oyl enough, it would ſtill ſay, O Lord, what's this if I go graceleſs, if my ſins be not forgiven me; take away my ſins Lord, though thou leave my ſorrows, and make me water my Couch with tears every day, and walk mournfully all the daies of my life: do any thing with me ſo my ſins may be done away: my heart will never be at eaſe till my ſins be forgiven. And this is not all, but if God ſhould further ſay to ſuch a Soul, I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thy ſin and remember it no more to charge it upon thee, but I will leave thee under the power and bondage of it; Oh Lord, would this foul ſay, though I bleſs thee for a pardon and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43845:109"/>that I ſhall by that be kept from being damned, yet Lord this doth not ſatis fie me, I have as hearty a requeſt to make that I may be purged, and that I may be taken from ſin, as that ſin may be taken from me, that I may be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſins dominion as from damnation. <hi>David</hi> doth not only pray, <hi>Lord blot out my tranſgreſſions,</hi> but <hi>Lord waſh me, and cleanſe me throughly from my ſin,</hi> Pſal. 51.1, 2. and (it ſeems) this was after the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſin,</hi> 2 Sam. 12, 13. and who but converted ones are of this frame? Others can be content with hearts eaſe, peace and good things, though they live in the love of one or other darling ſin, eſpecially if they do but entertain a conceit that God will pardon them, purging is not the thing that any do heartily mind but gracious Souls.</p>
                  <p>Beſide, there is this conſiderable and worthy of a remark as to theſe new-born ones, that though they have no aſſurance of a pardon nor have any great conqueſts over their corruptions, by reaſon whereof they have little ſatisfaction and much ſorrow, yet they can in their ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſedate frames truely ſay, that they are glad to hear and ſee that other Saints do God better ſervice than they do: they mourn that themſelves are no better, and yet rejoyce that there are any better than themſelves. Indeed in a fit and pang they do more than emulate, even envy thoſe happy and advanced ſouls, and yet (in cold blood as we ſay) cannot but be glad that God hath better ſervants than they are; that there are Sons in his houſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:43845:110"/>though they be but as hired Servants. Alas! ſaith ſuch a poor Babe, I am one of the moſt worthleſs wretches on earth, I live at ſo poor, low and inconſiderable a rate, that I am aſhamed of my ſelf, and am not worthy to be called a Chriſtian, but notwithſtanding this I can through grace rejoyce, that God hath his <hi>Abrahams, Davids, Jobs, Pauls,</hi> &amp;c. who glorifie his name at a better rate. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the happineſs of and bleſs them, who ſtand before the Lord and miniſter to his name and glory; as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did <hi>Solomons</hi> Servants. Yea if at any time in any thing they have been inſtrumental to the glory of God and ſerviceable to his name and people (as the Babes were, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10.) they are glad of it, though they have not yet the reward of it, but God ſeems to have forgotten it, and they themſelves do ſcarce keep it in mind, as appears by <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.37. But now take Hypocrites and Formaliſts, they grudge what they do, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. and profeſs Chriſt Jeſus out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to the Saints, as vying with them for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15, 16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. New-born ones will not depart from God; let God (ſay they) deal with us how he will, yet this is the reſolve of our ſouls, we will never leave him nor forſake him, for all the pleaſures, profits and preferments of this world; no, though he kill us we will truſt in him. Though God uſe them like the Dogs under his Table, and feed them with but a bit and a knock too, and give them not a meal of the Childrens bread, yet they will thank him
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:43845:110"/>for what they have and wait for more, as the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> did. Will an Hypocrite do this, wait and pray alwaies? I trow not. Theſe Babes ſay to God as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi,</hi> I will not leave thee, but will follow thee and the Lamb, though to the Grave, come of it what will; <hi>In the way of thy Judgements</hi> will we wait on thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8. If (like <hi>Ephraim</hi>) they are under the chaſtenings of God, and be for a while as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke, yet they cry out again, <hi>Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned;</hi> they return and repent, they ſmite on the thigh and are aſhamed; and God hears this as the voice of his dear child, and doth remember them, and will <hi>ſurely</hi> have mercy on them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18,—20. If (like <hi>Iſrael</hi>) they have followed other lovers, and God therefore hedge up their way with Thorns, yet they return to their firſt Husband and grant it to be their folly that they departed from him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. Though <hi>Peter</hi> fail of his promiſe and plighted troth, yet he weeps bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and makes it good at laſt, that he will rather die than utterly and finally forſake or deny him: and ſo 'tis with every Babe in Chriſt, who though they fall yet fall not away, but return and live. Only, let me leave this caution, Take not up with theſe words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this work, with fancy without feeling. It may be ſome Hypocrite or Formaliſt may hear this and give it out as if he had attained this; but 'tis not what the words of our mouth are, but what the frame of our heart is: 'tis not ſaying but feeling, not expreſſion
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:43845:111"/>but experience that will warrant us to be in ſuch a ſtate. 'Tis not being able to ſay theſe things by heart, but having them in our heart, and holding them forth in our lives that will do us good.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the things which I lay down as the characteriſtical diſcoveries of new-born ones, which diſtinguiſh them not only from common ſinners, but from the moſt refined Hypocrites and Formaliſts: I have not pitcht on many leſt I ſhould clog, nor on doubtful ones leſt I ſhould amuſe poor Babes; but theſe which are eſſential to the new-birth ſtate, for indeed they are all promiſed in the new Covenant, and wrought in all their hearts with whom the Covenant is made, and that is with all Saints as ſuch and not with reſpect to degrees, as ſome promiſes are (which was hinted long ſince) Let us examine the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and we ſhall find all theſe things punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly ſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31,—34. with 32.38,—40.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I will be their God and they ſhall be my people.</hi> This is not only promiſed, but effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and wrought; and as 'tis in Gods heart to be their God, ſo 'tis in their heart to be Gods people; and the one and other is deſired by them, which made the firſt head.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>I will put my Law into their hearts.</hi> This is not to be laid up there as writings in a cheſt to be idle and without effect, but 'tis there that they may do it, that they may fear the Lord and keep his Commandments: that they breath after full obedience thereunto, which made the ſecond head,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:43845:111"/> 3. <hi>I will remember their ſin no more.</hi> Which notes not only forgiving but ſubduing of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 14. which makes the third Head.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>They ſhall not depart from me.</hi> That is, wholly and finally: as God will not leave them totally, ſo nor they God: which is the fourth Head.</p>
                  <p>Now this is clear as the Sun, that the new Covenant Promiſes and frames are found ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in all Saints, and in none but Saints: that is, the end of all and none but redeemed ones, which is the end of the Redeemer, and that is to be holy, <hi>&amp;c. Tit.</hi> 2.14. and that becomes the aim and end of Elected ones, which is Gods in Electing, and that you may read, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. God the Father, Son and Spirit are one and agree in one. Election, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Sanctification to Salvation have one and the ſame ſubjects; and all theſe have one and the ſame deſire as to the things deſigned, they all agree in breathing after the effects of God the Father, Son and Spirits deſign, which no other perſons do.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, theſe things may not be acted alike powerfully and diſcernably at all times, but they are rooted and riveted in them, and do more or leſs appear in their effects upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Take the beſt of Saints, and they are not acted alwaies alike; ſome of them are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for a particular grace which hath appeared moſt evidently, and run moſt evenly through the whole courſe of their lives; as <hi>Abraham</hi> for Faith; <hi>Iſaac</hi> for fear, and therefore God is called the fear of <hi>Iſaac, viz.</hi> the God whom
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:43845:112"/>he feared; <hi>Jacob</hi> for Prayer, and therefore the Seekers and praying people are called his ſeed; <hi>Moſes</hi> for meekneſs; <hi>Job</hi> for patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not but that theſe met with ſome interruptions and breaks, of which weighty reaſons might be given, were it ſeaſonable here. So take any Claſſis of Saints, and they have variety of leſſons to take out, ſeveral Books to read, and ſeveral exerciſes to perform; now when they are about any-one of theſe, the reſt ſeem not to be or to lie dormant for that time, though it be not ſo, but they adminiſter a ſecret contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to one another in their turns. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Saints are moſt exerciſed about their own emptineſs and inſufficiency; ſometimes about the riches and freeneſs of grace; ſometimes about the beauty of holineſs and uſefulneſs of good works; ſometimes ſorrow and fear, at another time love and joy take hold of them; by reaſon of this variety and turning ſome are prone to think that they were never converted till they came to act ſo and ſo, which is but grace putting it ſelf forth in another way of growth; as the ſap of a tree doth firſt in buds, then in leaves and bloſſomes, and then in fruit, which fruit alſo hath its time to ripen, and its form and colour is very various till it come to its maturity and be perfectly ripe. I take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak of theſe things out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to poor Babes, who are too apt to miſtake and miſ-judge, and to let them know that if they will judge aright of their ſtate, they muſt not judge by what is proper and peculiar to an higher Claſſis and ſize of Saints, but by what
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:43845:112"/>is proper to the new-birth as ſuch, what is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and makes the ſpecifical difference, which degrees do not do, <hi>Gradus non variat ſpeciem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next thing we ſhould Catechiſe and examine our ſelves about, is, whether we are but Babes; perhaps many a Profeſſor hath been long in the School of Chriſt, and yet is but in the loweſt Form to this day: 'tis not time and ſtanding, length of daies and many years, but experiences and attainments that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate an Advance: the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> were Babes, though for their time they had been long in Chriſt. Would we therefore know whether we are but Babes ſtill, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the defects and carnalities of Babes ſpoken of before, and not expect a repetition of them here. As the beginnings of grace, and their eating Milk, with the other eſſential (Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) frames newly mentioned, do give us to know that they are Babes, new-born ones; ſo their defects and being <hi>as</hi> carnal, give us to know that they are but Babes: examine your ſelves therefore, commune with the Word and with your own hearts, compare them together, look into the Glaſs (as St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks) and ſee what manner of hearts and faces you have, and be not forgetful hearers, as you may be, though you remember all theſe Sermons word for word, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.25.

Oh that I might yet intreat, perſwade and prevail with ſuch to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their way and the end thereof, which is Hell, if they turn not to God, and believe in Chriſt Jeſus. To you, poor ſouls, I have ſpoken before by way of conviction and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation too, under the two heads of Repentance and Faith, when I made Application thereof, which I intreat you to peruſe and conſider, that I may not ſpeak the ſame things over and over. Further,</p>
                  <p>And beſide that, I have two other things to ſay unto unto you, by way of Exhortation; 1. Do not offend any of Chriſts little ones, no not his Babes. 2. Be not offended with
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43845:113"/>Chriſt and Religion, becauſe of Babes, though they be yet but <hi>as</hi> carnal.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let me exhort and beſeech you not to offend theſe little ones, the leaſt and weakeſt of the ſtock of Chriſt: 'tis a great ſin, and a ſin which will be greatly puniſhed to offend one of Chriſts little ones. If not for their ſake or Gods ſake, yet for thine own ſake take heed of this ſin. There is an enmity in the heart of ſinners againſt the ſeed of God, which they expreſs by reproaches and perſecutions, by which they are injurious to and do offend and wrong them; but oh that they would hear and fear and do no more ſo wickedly, for Jeſus Chriſt doth not only take notice of what offences are committed again his perſon and dectrine, but of what are committed againſt his people, the very leaſt of them. Conſider what himſelf hath ſaid in this caſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.6, —10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall offend</hi> (i. e. deſpiſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.) <hi>one of theſe little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea:</hi> This being thus drowned was lookt on as a dreadful puniſhment, but that's nothing compared with being thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depth of Hell, with a Milſtone weight and load of thine offences about thy neck: for if Jeſus Chriſt deal ſeverely with them that were not merciful to his people, as he will, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41,—45. how, oh how will he deal with them that have been cruel to his people? Eſpecially ſeeing 'tis a cruelty to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! Of this not only <hi>their</hi> Angels carry tydings,

                  <p n="2">2. Take heed ye be not offended with Chriſt and Religion becauſe of the Babes who are yet as carnal: as it ſhould and doth oblige Gods people not to be as carnal, leſt they give the enemies of God (as <hi>David</hi> did) an occaſion to blaſpheme, and cauſe the way of truth to be evil ſpoken of; ſo it obligeth the men of this world not to be offended with and to blaſpheme the way of God and his people, becauſe ſome of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Babes, are yet <hi>as</hi> carnal and walk as men. The worldly ſeed is hugely illogical and draw many <hi>non ſequiturs,</hi> for ſay they, <hi>Theſe profeſſors are as bad as others, they are all alike, and this is their Religion.</hi> Not ſo neither, for though they are as carnal, yet they are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and in the fleſh as other men are, <hi>(nullum ſimile eſt idem)</hi> though they be too much like, yet they are not carnal men, for they are in Chriſt Jeſus; and though they take too many
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43845:114"/>ſteps after the manner of men, yet they walk nor (their whole converſation is not) after or according to the fleſh as other men, who are in and walk according to the fleſh; and though ſome are <hi>as</hi> carnal, yet all are not ſo, there are who are ſpiritual and walk in and according to the Spirit. As for them that do otherwiſe, 'tis not their Religion but they are to blame, for they have not ſo learned Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, his doctrine teacheth not, but <hi>(dedocet tales mores)</hi> unteacheth them ſuch ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to walk as men. 'Tis the Devils Logick to draw an Argument from ſeeming to being, or from ſimilitude to Identity; from a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to a univerſal; and from the concrete to the abſtract: that becauſe they are as carnal, therefore they are but carnal and wholly ſo: becauſe one is bad, they are all alike; becauſe Profeſſors are to be blamed, therefore Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf is criminal! The grace of God hath taught all <hi>to deny ungodlineſs and wordly luſts, to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world;</hi> which if Prof;eſſors do not do, 'tis not graces fault but theirs, and therefore take heed ye be not offended with Chriſt and Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of them. And you profeſſors learn from hence to walk circumſpectly, leſt the way and name of God be blaſphemed through you; and leſt Chriſt ſuffer, becauſe you ſin. Let not the world deſpiſe you, let them not have any occaſion given them by you to deſpiſe you and that which is better than you, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.

Though you can eat ſtrong meat now, yet time was you could eat but Milk.</p>
                  <p>The remembrance of theſe things will be of huge uſe to you to give God the glory of your higher attainments and all your advances from ſtep to ſtep: 'twill make you greatly uſeful to the inſtruction of Babes, which is one of your great works and duties: 'twill keep you low in your own eyes, when you ſee that you owe a beholdingneſs to God for bringing you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, meerly of and by his grace, not for any worth or merit of your own: 'twill help you to know that you were converted long ago, and not to think (as ſome are apt to do) that all the work was as nothing, till they came to ſuch or ſuch a pitch; which occaſions a neglect of them below that pitch, and an ingratitude to God for what went before it and led to it. Thus will it be many waies advantageous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the work of old.</p>

'Tis true, God had ſome little praiſe from you when but Babes, but now he expects much more: that you bring forth much fruit and be filled with it, that you be ſtrong in Faith, that you abound in love, that ye be filled with all wiſdom and knowledge, to walk worthy of God to all-well-pleaſing, and to do all to his glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be not aſhamed of your youngeſt brethren that are but Babes, <hi>Paul,</hi> nay Chriſt himſelf was not aſhamed to call them Brethren; but carry it lovingly, gently and tenderly towards them; you know the heart of a Babe, for you your ſelves were once Babes, as 'tis ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in behalf of the ſtranger, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.9. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.33, 34.

                  <p n="1">1. TO be glad that they are Babes, new-born and in Chriſt Jeſus. Glad, alas! there's no comfort for me, who am but a Babe; no, yes but there is, that thou art a Babe, though but a Babe: 'tis true, it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thee <hi>as</hi> carnal, but <hi>as</hi> a Babe in Chriſt: the leaſt work of God is great conſolation to the leaſt of Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> to Babes. Conſider, whether this be nothing,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That thou haſt attained to the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>viz.</hi> from being dead and loſt in ſin; thou art called out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and art called his Son, and as ſuch brought out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> the work is begun, thou art new-born, and eateſt Milk, the Foundation is laid, and is this nothing? who knows to what a great Tree this little Muſtard-ſeed of Grace may grow? The Babe that lies in the Cradle may become a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and is this nothing? He that hath laid the Foundation will lay the top-ſtone, and thou ſhalt cry out with ſhouting, Grace, Grace unto it. God is not like the fooliſh
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43845:117"/>Builder, he hath caſt up his coſt, and hath wherewithal to finiſh what he hath begun, he will not be laught at and mocked as one that laid a Foundation, began to build, but could not finiſh it: though thou be a knotty piece, yet he will fit thee for thy place, and perfect that which concerns thee; for this work is not only that of his hand, but of his heart; and is this nothing? Pray to him and believe, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou art not only brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but he hath drawn thee into the Wilderneſs, and though thou be in the Valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> yet even there is a door of hope. Thou art bewildered, and thy motions are full of wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and turnings; now forward and then backward almoſt to <hi>Egypt</hi> again, that thou ſeemeſt to wander rather than to walk or to go a journey; true, but yet thou art in thy way and God is leading thee to his holy Hill, Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> 'Tis obſervable how differently the condition of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (and ſo thine) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.4. with 7. in the 4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 'tis ſaid, they wandred in the wilderneſs; but in the 7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 'tis ſaid, he led them forth: in the 4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 'tis called a ſolitary way; but in the 7. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 'tis called the right way: in the 4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> they found no (and deſpaired to find any) City to dwell in; yet <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. that they might go to a City of habitation: So 'tis with thee, poor ſoul, and notwithſtanding thy unbelief and murmurings, yet he holds thy Soul in Life, and when thou art hungry and thirſty he provides food and drink convenient for thee;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43845:118"/>and thy Cloaths ſhall nor wear out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thy being a Babe hath more of incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement than diſcouragement in it: Thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Babe in Chriſt is more to thy ſafety, than thy being <hi>as</hi> carnal is to thy danger, though it muſt be thy ſorrow: Babe is the name of a Saint not of a carnal man, and it makes more for thee that thou art a Babe, than it doth againſt thee that thou art <hi>as</hi> carnal. Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thy Joy that thou art born? though thou be not yet cloathed with a robe, nor kiſt with thy Fathers lips? 'Twas more for the Prodigal that he was alive, than againſt him, that he had been dead, and came home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out raggs, even naked and bare. 'Twas more for the Diſciples that the Spirit was willing, than againſt them that the fleſh was weak. 'Tis ſo with us as to our Babes, their being ours doth more indear them to us, than their being froward and peeviſh doth diſingage us to them. And though the elder Brother chargeth his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as guilty of an indiſcreet and partial fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make ſo much of a Prodigal, yet he ſtill owns it as meet that they ſhould rejoyce, and be glad.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though thou be <hi>as</hi> carnal, yet on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of this thy carnality thou art angry with it and thy ſelf, and doſt repent and abhor thy ſelf as in duſt and aſhes. The <hi>Corin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> Babes were no ſooner convinced of theirs, but they made the Apoſtle glad by their ſorrow, ſeeing their ſorrow wrought Repentance never to be repented of, becauſe it was to Salvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. Yea thus it was with the Inceſtuous
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:43845:118"/>perſon himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4, 7. ſo that the Apoſtle on the account of this ingenuous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance pronounceth them clear, and him a perſon to be comforted. Now the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation belongs to thee if thou do likewiſe; and I am ſure 'tis in thy new nature to do it, when ever thou art under the conviction of thy ſin: and I can ſafely tell thee that ſin repented of (as theirs was) will not be laid to thy charge.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though thou be but a Babe yet God hath ſome praiſe from thee; 'tis true indeed he hath more from others, but yet 'tis true that he hath ſome from thee: thou doſt help to perfect his praiſe. 'Tis one of the burthens of theſe poor ſouls that they are ſuch unprofitable ſervants, not only (as others are) in that they do but their duty, but alas in that they do not do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but fall ſhort of it and the glory of God: herein is God glorified when much fruit is brought forth, but as for us, ſay they, we bring forth but little. 'Tis true, but yet thy Mite of grace gives a meaſure of glory; all the good-ground Hearers brought forth fruit to the glory of God, though ſome more than others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.8. When the Phariſees were diſpleaſed at the <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s aſcribed to Chriſt by little ones, and are angry with him that he had not rebuked them, as if they had taken Gods name in vain, for ſay they with a ſcorn, <hi>Heareſt thou what theſe ſay?

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43845:119"/>with joy and gladneſs, as that which full-fills a Scripture, and helps to fill up the praiſe and glory of God. A Babe is one of the joynts and members of the Body, and ſupplies its meaſure even to the perfection of praiſe. As 'tis in Nature, there is one glory of the Heavens, another of the Earth; <hi>One of the Son, and another of the Moon and Stars;</hi> the Heavens declare his glory, and the Earth his goodneſs, for 'tis full of it; the Sacred and Royal P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For as 'tis in Nature, ſo 'tis in grace, not only the greateſt, but leſſer Luminaries; not only the higheſt but the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt creatures do contribute ſomething to the praiſe of God: the Sun indeed ſhines bright, and gives a great luſtre, but the Stars alſo do twinkle; ſo though an <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. is ſtrong in Faith giving great glory to God, yet Gods praiſe is not fully perfected, till the Babes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution be taken in, ſmall though it be. In the body, the leaſt member; in an Houſe the leaſt Pin hath its uſe and tends to the perfecting of the whole; and veſſels of an inferiour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſerve not a little to eek out the glory of more honourable one</p>
                  <p>The Milk that the Babes do eat, doth every ſpoonful of it, give praiſe and glory to God: Repentance doth ſo, Faith towards God, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Ordinances, trembling at his Word, deſires after growth, love of the Brethren;

And the truth of it is, that 'tis not a little glory which accrews to God hereby; for, that theſe poor Babes who have ſo much corruption (and not without conſiderable temptations too) ſhould yet be kept from Apoſtafie; that Grace ſhould live (like a ſpark of fire in the midſt of waters) and not be extinct, is a wonder; and ſuch an one, as that 'tis not ſo great a wonder that other Saints of higher Forms cleave cloſe to God, as that theſe do; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Branch of this Uſe is to exhort Babes to be humbled that they are but Babes, <hi>i. e.</hi> as carnal, and not paſt the ſpoon, and ſo incapable of having ſtrong meat to eat, or of any more than the Alphabet of Religion, ſuch as we Preach to ſinners, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance, and Faith towards God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is but Milk: and this eſpecially concerns them, who are old in years, and yet but Babes as to underſtanding and practice, who have been profeſſors of long ſtanding, but little proficiency. 'Tis a prime part of the Chriſtians ingenuity to be low and vile in his own eyes, under the ſenſe of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections and defects, yea and that though God be pacified towards him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.60,—63.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:43845:120"/>Let Babes therefore that are as carnal, though they be in Chriſt Jeſus, be very humble in the ſenſe of their defectiveneſs, and, which is worſe, their carnality. Eſpecially conſidering,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they have enjoyed means and helps by which they might have been more ſpiritual, had they not been dull of hearing. We are all careful to uſe means, but we ſhould take one care more, and that is to make uſe of means to profit thereby, the want whereof calls for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbled. The Apoſtle might well twit the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Babes with this, you boaſt of <hi>Paul, Apollo</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> but is it not a ſhame to you to be carnal under ſuch mens Miniſtry? The more perſons are priviledged with means, the more improved ſhould they be by the means; and if not ſo, they ſhould be the more humbled for their non-proficiency. Many of you have had not only the Milk but the Cream of the Goſpel, and are ye yet carnal? let it then be for a lamentation and anſwerable Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be the more humbled conſidering that many of the more refined ſort of Heathens would have ſcorned to be ſo carnal as ſome of you: the Apoſtle upbraids the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Babes and thereby provokes them to ſhame by this very thing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2. It is reported com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly (and in this, <hi>fama non eſt mendax,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is no Lyar) that there is Fornication among you, and ſuch Fornication, as is not ſo much as named (recorded of any) amongſt the Gentiles, that one ſhould have his Fathers Wife, and yet ye are puffed up and have not

Let your Humiliation and Humility be the more, that ye have been better taught, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17,—21. and that for a long time, <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpent a year and an half among theſe <hi>Corinthians, Act.</hi> 18.11. and had written to them two or three times, and was yet ready to come again to correct their B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe grace hath abounded toward us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. And 2. our labour is not, nor ſhall be, in vain in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. But 3. an abundant entrance ſhall be miniſtred to us, into the Kingdom of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viout, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8,—11. And leſt we ſhould ſear and deſpond as if 'twere not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we are Fourthly to knew this, That God is able to make grace abound, 2 <hi>Gor.</hi> 9.8. Let us therefore go on to perfection, from Babes to little Children, from little Children to Young-men, from Young-men to Fathers; till we all come into the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13,—16.</p>
                  <p>In relation hereunto I ſhall add to what hath been ſaid, 1. Some Conſiderations to provoke to growth. 2. Some helps to further and promote growth. To the firſt, in brief, none knows but he may attain to more than a Babe and therefore ſhould preſs forward on theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The higheſt Saints (Fathers) preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and therefore much more ſhould you. See how <hi>Paul</hi> preſſeth forward, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8,—14. Shall one that hath attained ſo much as he had, be ſo preſſing, and will not you that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but little? Let the zeal of the higheſt provoke the loweſt to zeal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Little Grace hath but a little comfort:
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43845:123"/>Though the Babe have enough for a being, yet but a little for well-being. <hi>Vivere eſt valere,</hi> to live is not barely to be, but to enjoy ones ſelf and to be well; as to this Life we do not take care only for ſo much as will keep life and ſoul together, but that we may live comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: and ſhall we not much more endeavour it as to our ſpiritual life? Little Faith is full of Fear (which exclules preſent joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) and is as no Faith in that reſpect, for ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of-little Faith?</hi> which <hi>Mark</hi> 4.40. is thus expreſt, <hi>Why are ye ſo fearful? how is it that ye have no Faith?</hi> Would ye therefore have leſs fear and more joy? preſs forward then to grow in grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Little grace gives but little glory to God; 'tis true, the Babe contributes ſomething to the perfecting of Gods praiſe, but 'tis very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; herein is our Father glorified when we bring forth <hi>much</hi> fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8. 'Tis being filled with fruits of righteouſneſs which brings full glory to God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11. And <hi>Abraham</hi> being ſtrong in Faith gave glory to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. If therefore you would glorifie God to purpoſe, grow in Grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. While you are but Babes you are of little uſe to others; 'tis true, the leaſt member is of ſome uſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. but 'tis of leaſt uſe. A Candle may give ſome light, but none in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what the Sun gives: Now, we ſhould be (as <hi>John</hi> was) not only burning but ſhining lights: and our light ſhould ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee our good works,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43845:123"/>and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I proceed to give you ſome Directions by way of help and aſſiſtance, to promote and advance grace to growth: If and as ever you would grow in grace be exhorted,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To be humble and lowly in mind; Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mihty promotes us, 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to aſcend downward. Humility and a low eſteem of our ſelves is the ready way to grow high. The Trees ſpread moſt upward that have the deepeſt roots. Before Honour is Humility, 'tis Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Uſher, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.33. He that is lifed up is like to fall, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.12. ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. with <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some Babes alas are apt to be puſſed up (though without cauſe) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. but pride hinders growth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be thankful for what's received: ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unthankful perſons never or ſeldom thrive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Becauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, they became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh bearts were darkened, profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools.</hi> But he that bleſſeth God for what he hath, is like to be bleſt with more, as <hi>Luke</hi> 19.16,—26. <hi>To every one that hath</hi> (thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his Receipts and Improvements) <hi>ſhall be given</hi> (more) but <hi>from him that hath not, even that which he hath</hi> (or as <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18. that which he thinks he hath or ſeems to have) <hi>ſhall be taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

'Tis no little help to growth to be united one to another in oneneſs of mind and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they are not like to come to much excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency that are divided in <hi>Jaceb</hi> and ſcattered in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for where there are diviſions, there is leaſt contribution of help and mutual aſſiſtance. When the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Babes <hi>to be perfect,</hi> he ſubjoynes this as conducing thereunto, <hi>he of one mind, live in peace,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. for Love is the bond of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. and the bleſſing of the God of love and peace will be with ſuch, as the Apoſtle tells them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. and his bleſſing maketh rich, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.22.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Attend conſcientiouſly and with eager deſires on the word of grace that you may grow thereby: uſe Ordinances to make uſe of them for your perfection; to which end they are as much deſigned as to bringing in, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. Paſtors and Teachers are for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt (and every member thereof) till we all come to a perfect man: <hi>Deſire</hi> therefore <hi>the ſincere Milk of the Word that you may grew thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Get better acquaintance with Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: The Apoſtle knew Chriſt Jeſus in a good meaſure; and yet that he might perfectly win him and perfection by him, and attain to the mark and the prize, he breaths and preſſeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more, even the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8,—14.

                  <p n="6">6. Would ye grow? make uſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes then, which are given not only that we might eſcape the pollutions which are in the world by luſt, and ſo be made partakers of a divine nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. but that we might <hi>cleanſe our ſilves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit to perfect holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. and might add grace to grace, to abound and be fruitful, as it follows in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5,—8. The Covenant refers to our being and birth, but the promiſes to our well-being and growth: if therefore <hi>Davids</hi> houſe do not grow he hath recourſe to the Covenant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. but that it may grow, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Promiſes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.25,—29.

                  </p>
                  <p>A little to inform you about making uſ of and improving promiſes, I ſhall (to prevent a miſtake) inlarge further on this head: Some perſons do think that the chief if not only way of improving promiſes is by believing (as they call it) than which I think there is ſcarce a greater miſtake, that is in this ſenſe; when they read or hear a promiſe (as that God will be a Father, that all things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) they think there is to more required but to believe that God will make this good, and do as he hath promiſed; there is no queſtion but he will, for he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that hath promiſed and cannot lye; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved let me tell you (leſt you deceive your ſelves) that 'tis not ſo much Faith as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and practice which is neceſſary to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of theſe promiſes: if you practiſe the duty to which the promiſe is made, God will make it good, whether you believe it or no, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11,—13. but if you believe it a thouſand times over and do not do the duty, God is under no obligation to make good the promiſe. If you love not God, how can you expect that all things ſhould work together for good to you, when the promiſe is made to none
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43845:125"/>but lovers of God: ſo if you ſeparate not from uncleanneſs, how can you expect God will be a Father to you, when 'tis promiſed only to them that ſeparate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Take heed then of an idle and dead Faith: 'tis true, Faith is a duty, but not Faith alone, Faith that's idle and dead; what ever promiſes are made to Faith, ſhall be made good to Faith; and what ever promiſes are made to Love, to Humility, to Patience, ſhall be made good when theſe graces are acted. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23, 24. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Let us hold faſt</hi> (this) <hi>profeſſion of our Faith without wavering, for he is faithful that hath promiſed:</hi> by which we ſee that there can be no Plerophorie or full aſſurance of Faith (without the other qualifications therewith mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> a true heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) by which we can expect the performance of promiſes, This I thought good to hint, that none might think Faith enough in relation to the promiſes without obeying in that very particular to which the promiſe is made. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Would you attain to perfection, be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent then: Babes are apt to be impatient and peeviſh, for which they have been already noted; but impatiency hinders growth; as ever therefore you would be perfect, let pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have its perfect work, then ſhall ye be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect, intire and lack nothing (<hi>viz.</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4. Patience is a compleating and perfecting grace, as God ſpeaks to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>

So the good-ground-hearers bringing forth fruit with patience, is oppoſed to the Thorny-ground-hearers not bringing forth fruit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.14, 15. ſo that patience doth not a little contribute to the bringing forth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fruit, and to our growing up to a perfect ſtature. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It eſtabliſheth the heart, makes it ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and immoveable, which helps to abounding and growth, as appears by the places where they are joyned together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18. While perſons hang looſe and are toſſed to and fro (as Babes are apt to be, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14.) they are not in a growing conditior: but patience doth ſettle, fix and eſtabliſh the ſoul, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Be patient, ſtabliſh your hearts,</hi> i.e. ſtabliſh them by patience: For, as 'tis hinted in a parallel place, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.19. <hi>In patience we poſſeſs our ſouls;</hi> when as an impatient man is wavering and unſtable, is uncertain, inconſtant and double-minded, ever doubtful and in ſuſpenſe, and therefore receives little if any thing from the Lord, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6,—8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Patience helps the ſoul to wait notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding diſappointments and ſufferings: diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are diſcouraging things, they diſhearten, weaken and make us faint, and ſo put us under an incapacity of thriving,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43845:126"/>but patience ſteels and ſtrengthens our hearts; when hope deferred makes us ſick, patience gives ſupports and cordials, inabling to wait till the hoped and long'd for deſire be granted, which is as a Tree of Life. This may be ſeen in ſuch places as theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23,—25, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35.36. and 12.1. Both theſe waies (to name no more) doth patience help us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. As ever you would grow and proceed to perfection, watch over your hearts and lives, and keep your accounts well, obſerving how you gain or loſe day by day: narrowly view your daily experiences conſidering what's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and what's lacking, that you may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what's behind (ſo as to reſt in it) and preſs forward to what is yet before, as the Apoſtle did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. They are not like to thrive that keep not their Books and Accounts well, but let all go at fix and ſeven, and run at random: As ever you would grow, keep your diurnal, monthly and annual annotations, for elſe how can you diſcern the difference between what you were, are and ought to be?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And laſtly, make Conſcience of Prayer, your own and others: Praying Saints, and Saints Prayed for are moſt like to proſper. The great Apoſtle not only prayed himſelf, but often beg'd the Prayers of others (his inferiours alſo) for himſelf; much more ſhould you, who being but ſickly Saints cannot pray as much and well as you ought for your ſelves, and therefore ſhould call in the help of Elders and the Church to pray for you. Read over the

            <p>Before I come to the next rank, <hi>viz.</hi> Little Children, 'twill be convenient to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of two or three things; 1. That what is here written to the (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) Sons or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which is the name in common to all theſe three following diviſions of Saints (Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Young-men, and Little Children) I ſay, what ever is written to them in common (as <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1 and 12. and 28. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.7. and 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.21.) doth more or leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern each of them, the higheſt as well as

In that he writes to Fathers, that the Fathers are not paſt teaching, though they be the higheſt Form: 'The beſt may be yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Fathers may be more ſo than they are, they that have attained to moſt may attain to more, the moſt perfect may be more perfect, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12,—15. And 3. in that he uſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral and various arguments to ingage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke all to the ſame things, we may obſerve that the moſt likely way to prevail with perſons (whom we ſpeak or write to) is to uſe ſuch reaſons and arguments as are moſt proper and peculiar to them: As, <hi>I write to you Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> (to this and that purpoſe) <hi>becauſe ye have known him that is from the beginning; I write to you Young-men, becauſe ye have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the wicked one; I write unto you little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe ye have known the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to come nearer to our purpoſe; There are in this Text three ſorts of Saints denominated from and characterized by their ſeveral and ſpecial attainments and excellencies; and though many other things are wrapt up and included in and under them, yet theſe which are named are the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Apex,</hi> the <hi>Culmen,</hi> the Top, the Crown and chief excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of each of them: This is the Fathers, that they are perſons of great, much and long experience and wiſdom, having known him that is from, and having known him from the firſt or beginning: This is Young-mens excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that they are perſons of ſtrength and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, <hi>having overcome the wicked one:</hi> This is the excellency of the Little Children, that they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43845:129"/>are perſons aſſured of Gods Love, having known him as their Father. And ſo this ſtate of little Children is (we ſee) a middle ſtate between Babes (whom they excel) and Young-men to whoſe excellency they have not yet attained, much leſs to that of Fathers.</p>

The time of their having had this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, implyed, <hi>viz.</hi> you have lately known the Father; 'tis not long ſince that you were new-born and were but Babes.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43845:132"/>Love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.4, 5. and for their ſakes I ſhall make ſearch (though it may ſeem a digreſſion) to find out the footſteps of Gods way in this particular caſe. But before I enter upon it, 'twill be neceſſary to premiſe 2. things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God is free in his choice, and may chuſe out whom he pleaſe, his Spirit bloweth (this gale of knowledge and aſſurance of the Fathers Love) when and where he pleaſeth; 'tis no trade-wind, if I may ſo ſay. God is not under any obligation, nor is bound to any man, but to whom he pleaſeth: as he ſhews mercy to whom he will, ſo 'tis what degrees of mercy he will to any; perſons and times are wholly at Gods diſpoſe; 'tis not in him that willeth nor in him that runneth (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the ſtory of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s bleſſing <hi>Jacob</hi> inſtead of <hi>Eſau</hi>) but in God that ſheweth (this as all other) mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God hath been pleaſed to pick and chuſe out ſome perſons upon whom he hath fixed ſo ſpecial a love as to make them his darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to make himſelf known as a Father to them. Among all the Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> was he whom Jeſus loved (<hi>viz.</hi> peculiarly) as 'tis often mentioned by the Evangeliſts; he loved all his Family, but <hi>John</hi> was his boſom-diſciple and favourite: As when Fathers have many Children, only one is <hi>the</hi> beloved, and kiſt more often than all the reſt ('twas <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s caſe beyond all his Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.3.) ſo it is here: God is pleaſed to pitch upon ſome to ſhew ſpecial ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of his love unto them. And he hath done it uſually (and promiſed to do it) to ſuch as theſe.</p>

The reaſon that many give why <hi>John</hi> was the beloved Diſciple, is this, That he came in to Chriſt while very young. We have a common affection to all Children <hi>as ours,</hi> but if we find a towardlineſs and ingenuity budding and bloſſoming in any very timely, it endears them to us, and we have a peculiar and ſpecial affection for them, and uſe to ſhew it by kindneſſes, tokens, ſmiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and truly God himſelf doth uſually do ſo. <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Scripture records them as ſpecial favourites, who were converted and did turn to God, when they were young: God remembers the kindneſs of <hi>Iſraels</hi> youth, and the love of eſpouſals, which was while they were young, and went after him in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2. and then had they wonderful diſcoveries of his love. Not to mention <hi>Abel; Joſeph</hi> was very gracious and tender-hearted, for he could not bear with
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:43845:133"/>the wickedneſs of his Brethren, even then when he was but ſeventeen years old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.2. and preſently hereupon God appeared to him, as to <hi>Solomon,</hi> twice, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. and 9. <hi>Samuel</hi> miniſtred to the Lord, while yet a very Child for years, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.18. and 3.1. to him did the Lord appear, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. and though at firſt he underſtood not the voice and Word of the Lord, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. yet ſoon after he did, <hi>And Samuel grew and the Lord was with him,</hi> Verſ. 19. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was well given (as we ſay) and very good at ſixteen years of age: he began to raign at eight years old, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.1. and in the eighth year of his reign (which was the ſixteenth of his age; while he was yet young (as the Text remarques it) he began to ſeek after the God of his Father <hi>David,</hi> and in the twelfth year (when twenty years old) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to purge <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem, Verſ.</hi> 3, &amp;c.

I have been under humiliations a long time, ſin hath coſt me dear, my bones (as <hi>David</hi> ſaid) yea and mine heart have even broken with ſighs and groans, and I am ſtill watering my Couch with my tears; yea they are my drink; and yet I cannot obtain a ſmile, not a good word nor a good look from God: but he ſeems to call me Dog and caſt me off! wo is me!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But poor ſoul, remember, 1. What I newly ſaid, that God is not bound to make himſelf known as a Father to thee; he will not be commanded into this condeſcenſion: nor muſt thou think to bribe and compound with him by Prayers and Tears. 2. Remember that though God have taken vengeance on ſome
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:43845:135"/>mens ſins, yet he hath forgiven them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99 8. and who knows but he may deal ſo with thee, and not turn thee into Hell, nor deal with thee as thine iniquity deſerves, though he make thee know much (and yet much more) ſorrow and ſmart. 3. Conſider that perhaps thine humiliation hath been hitherto but legal and ſelfiſh; that thou haſt been more concern'd that God was diſpleaſed with thee, than that he was diſpleaſed by thee; that thy Tears have been more for the ſhame and pain than for the ſinfulneſs of ſin as againſt God: if ſo, be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for this alſo, and in due time he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt thee to a better condition, or ſave thee at laſt with a notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God doth uſually manifeſt himſelf (and his love) as a Father to them that hunger and thirſt after, and are greatly in love with his Son Jeſus Chriſt: in him God is well pleaſed, and declared from Heaven, That he was his beloved Son; and he is pleaſed to do the like for them that love his Son: God will that we honour the Son as we do the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. Now him that honoureth me (and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that honoureth my Son) I will honour, ſaith the Lord. What honour will God confer upon ſuch? <hi>viz.</hi> they ſhall be called (not only be but be called, manifeſted and declared to be) the Children of God, and <hi>behold what manner of love this is!</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1. When the Spouſe was ſick of love, ſhe was much made of: and to <hi>Mary</hi> who loved much, there was much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and ſpecial manifeſtations of love made unto her. Our Saviour tells his Diſciples that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:43845:135"/>the Father loved them, for this very reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they loved him; and that ſhortly they ſhould have clear and plain manifeſtations of the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.25.—27. according to what he promiſeth to all that love him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21,—23.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God hath promiſed to be known as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to them that do ſeparate from and are not unequally yoked with unbelievers, and that do not touch the unclean thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 17, 18. which is more (as to manifeſtation, love and joy) than to be known to us as our God, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Wherefore come cut from among them and be ye ſeparate,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>touch not the unclean thing,</hi> and I will receive you (<hi>viz.</hi> into my favour, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces and boſom) and I will be a Father to you, and you ſhall be my Sons and Daughters; and you ſhall be treated accordingly. For this reaſon was Chriſt himſelf anointed with the oyl of gladneſs above his fellows, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. and as any of his are conformable to him in the ſeparation (which love of righteouſneſs and hatred of iniquity makes) the more are they like to be anointed with the oyl of gladneſs above their fellows.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God uſually gives out manifeſtations and aſſurances of love to ſuch of his as are about to do and ſuffer great things for him; and this he gives them as a preparation thereunto. Chriſt Jeſus had the voice from Heaven a little before he entred upon his miniſtry. The Apoſtles had the Spirit ſent to prepare them for doing greater things than they had done in Chriſts time.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43845:136"/>And the reaſon that <hi>Paul</hi> had ſo early an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his election (and being dearly beloved) of God, was becauſe he was preſently to go about great undertakings and to undergo great ſufferings, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15, 16. ſo that he in a very little time in a few daies, paſt from the Babe-ſtate to that of a little Child, and from thence into that of a Young-man Saint: which few ſo ſuddenly do but on ſuch an occaſion as this. Thus have I diſcovered ſome of them (I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay all, for there is no confining nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of God) to whom he is pleaſed to make himſelf known as a Father, to call them out of the Form of Babes, and to place them in the ſecond higher Form, that of Children; and to give them aſſurance of his love that they may ſay unto him, Thou art our Father. Though I cannot ſay for whom of us God will do this, yet according to theſe preſidents 'tis more than probable, that if we be found among this number, we ſhall in due (and it may be in a little) time know the Father. But I muſt proceed to ſhew ſomething more largely how he is thus made known, by the witneſs of his Spirit.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>AT the beginning of this Chapter I began to ſhew how they came to know the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or (which is equivalent and all one) that they are the Children of God and dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of him; and that was by (not barely the working of the Spirit in them, but after and over and above that, by) the Spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing to them, clearing up that work to be of God which is wrought in their own hearts and ſpirits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. Here are two witneſſes (and both Spirits) that out of the mouth of two knowing witneſſes, this thing may be eſtabliſht: our ſpirit affirms, and the Spirit of God confirms. Our ſpirit knows what acts and workings are wrought in us and by us; our ſpirit affirms, that ſuch Repentance, Faith, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is in us, but whether this be wrought according to God our ſpirit by it ſelf cannot tell without and until the Spirit of God bear witneſs to it, that it is according to the Will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. of which I have given ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:43845:137"/>above in this, and more in the former Treatiſe of Babes. From whence I infer theſe two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this witneſs of the Spirit is not a thing common to all Saints (for Babes have it not, though they have the things which do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet they have not aſſurance, becauſe they have not the Spirit witneſſing with their ſpirit) 'tis not a thing that runs parallel with ſaintſhip, as having the work of the Spirit doth: <hi>If we have not the Spirit of Chriſt we are none of his,</hi> that's true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. but 'tis as true, that we may be his, though we have not the witneſs of his Spirit in us; for we are his before we have the witneſs of it; and the witneſs doth not make us ſo, but the Spirit finding us to be his, doth witneſs and declare that we are his. The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth not make us but manifeſt us to be, and to us that we are the Children of God, as the Text (and thing it ſelf) is clear, plain and full, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. That which is witneſſed to, muſt be before 'tis witneſſed unto. I ſhall add but one Text more to confirm this, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. where this is evident and apparent, that as they heard before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; ſo they believed before they were ſealed with the holy Spirit of Promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance; and which we had a little before we had this ſeal and earneſt. So that we were the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. before we have the witneſs of being Children. And though it be ſaid, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. that <hi>he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on the Son of God, hath the witneſs in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:43845:137"/>himſelf,</hi> as if every Believer had it; yet I have two or three things to ſay hereunto, 1. That St. <hi>John</hi> perhaps writ not to Babes, but to all the higher Forms, (of Children, Young-men, and Fathers) and all theſe indeed have the witneſs (of the Spirit) in themſelves: But 2. If we take in all (Babes among the reſt) it may alſo be ſaid of them that they have the thing which doth witneſs, and the witneſs of their own ſpirits; but it will not thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they have the witneſs of the Spirit or aſſurance, which is the thing that I am ſpeaking to. 'Tis as true that the three witneſſes in earth (in us below) agree in one, as 'tis that the three witneſſes in Heaven are one, <hi>Ver.</hi> 7, 8. Yet all three do not give out their witneſs all at once; the water and blood may and do witneſs before the Spirit doth. Yet again, 3. The witneſs in himſelf may be underſtood (and I think moſt properly) of that which is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, which is, that God hath given us Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and that by and in his Son, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. And accordingly he that believeth hath both the Son and Eternal Life in himſelf, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. 'Tis already begun in every Believer, though every one hath not the aſſurance of it, as is implyed in the thirteenth Verſe. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I infer that this witneſs of the Spirit is not barely or only the working of Grace (by the Spirit) in our hearts, but ſomething ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereunto, and ſuperadded thereupon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the gracious qualifications, which are called, <hi>The fruits of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. Whether it be a light ſhining upon their graces
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:43845:138"/>and making them clear; or whether it be the Application of ſome one or other promiſe made to ſuch graces; or whether it be ſome immediate eradiation and beaming forth of love from God upon the ſoul, it matters not; it may be by any or all of theſe waies. Let me a little illuſtrate it, by the heat and light of the Sun; The working of the Spirit is like to the heat and influence of the Sun, which reacheth all things; but the witneſs of the Spirit is like the light of the San, which ſhines not on all places at once; the work and influence of the Spirit reacheth all Saints, but the witneſs of the Spirit doth not ſhine upon all Saints at once, nor upon all in the ſame degree: Yea, I am apt to believe that aſſurance is a very great rarity, and not ſo much enjoyed as talked of, or pretended to. I have read of one Iſland, of which it is ſaid, that the Sun ſhines on it more or leſs every day of the year: it may be there are ſome ſuch Iſland-Saints, but I am inclinable to think, there are not many of them; becauſe, as I have ſomewhere hinted before in the Treatiſe of Babes, the greater part of Gods Children have not (I fear) yet attained to be little Children, to know and have aſſurance of the Fathers Love. 'Tis true the Fathers have; but how few are they? and that the conquering young men have; but how few are they? yea that the little Children have; but how few are they? There was but one <hi>John</hi> among the many Diſciples. However this is clear, that they who are of this Claſſis (be they few or many) have attained to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:43845:138"/>and it may be ſaid of them as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.15, 16, 17. <hi>Bleſſed are the people that know the joyful ſound, they ſhall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance, in thy name</hi> (which is gracious, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. named upon them) <hi>ſhall they rejoyce all the day, and in thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (the Lord our righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6.) <hi>ſhall they be exalted; for thou art the glory of their ſtrength, and in thy favour our horn ſhall be exalted!</hi> And now this gives me occaſion to conſider, 1 What this witneſs is. 2. How it may be diſcerned from illuſions of Satan, or the pretenſions and preſumptions of our own hearts.</p>

                  <p>THis witneſs of the Spirit (by which we know the Father as ours, and that we are the Children of God) is, 1. Clear and perſpicuous; 'tis no dark, cloudy diſcovery of a thing, but bright and illuſtrious: this brings evidence and demonſtration with it. Like him who at firſt ſaw men walking as Trees, but at the ſecond touch ſaw all things clearly, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.23,—25. This is not like the Oracles of the Heathen, a Trumpet which gives an uncertain and dubious ſound, nor like that of our own hearts, which though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t often excuſe, yet it often accuſeth and leaves us doubtful which to take for truth: no, this wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:43845:139"/>is not perplexed, nor tells either falſe or feigned, dark or dubious ſtories. He that runs may read it, 'tis written in ſo fair and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, in ſuch Text-hand and Capital and Golden Letters. 'Tis that we may know, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ecrto noſcamus, non fluctuante conjectura)</hi> 'tis not a conjecture, a perhaps, or, it may be, but as clear as the Sun in its Meridian brightneſs and ſtrength. This wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth not leave the ſoul under diſputings and fluctuations, it takes off all Scepticiſme, the thing is paſt diſpute. 'Tis not like the Spirit of the world which is ambiguous (as the Oracles newly mentioned) that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> for or againſt (like <hi>Aio te Aeacida Romanos vincere poſſe</hi>) but like the Oracles of God, of a clear and certain, and of an aſcertaining and aſſuring ſound. For,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As 'tis clear 'tis a ſure Teſtimony, 'tis true and faithful, and infallible: what the Spirit of God ſaith is as true, as that God is, and that God is true. This witneſs can be no otherwiſe, for 1. The Spirit which beareth teſtimony is the Spirit of truth, and therefore a Spirit of conſolation, <hi>the</hi> Comforter. He cannot lie, he cannot deceive, 'tis not only againſt his name but his nature which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his name, <hi>The Spirit of truth,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Devil, the deceiving ſpirit and father of lyes. No lye is of the truth, nor of the Spirit of truth; this Spirit guides into all truth, and nothing but the truth: he never bears witneſs to Hypocrites or Formaliſts (but only to new born ones) that they are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:43845:139"/>of God. 2. As the Spirit of truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceive, ſo he cannot be deceived, for he knows the deep things of God and men; what is in Gods heart to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11. and what is in our hearts towards God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. 'Tis a vanity as well or ill as Villany to lie to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. for he cannot be deceived, nor will be mocked; no nor can he be miſtaken, for he knows the deep things of God, and of man, though a mans heart be a great deep alſo. This witneſs of God is true and ſure: if we receve the witneſs of men, the witneſs of God is greater. 'Twas <hi>Pauls</hi> great comfort that God was his witneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4, 5. he would not ſatisfie himſelf with this, that he knew nothing by himſelf, but as he was approved of God ſo he expected his Juſtification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3,—5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17, 18. This witneſs is clear, true and ſure. And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis a powerful witneſs, for it ſatisfies and ſettles the Spirit of a man in a quiet, ſerene, peaceable and aſſured frame: the ſoul is carried by it above bondage and fear, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. 'tis like an oath that puts an end to ſtrife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. and ſo affords ſtrong Conſolation, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. The ſoul injoys God and it ſelf in Halcyon-daies and in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed calm of aſſurance; the ſoul retires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reſt, becauſe the Lord hath dealt bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with it, and it is upheld by his free and freeing Spirit, which hath ſet it at liberty and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Notwithſtanding this joy, yet (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently enough) they bluſh and are ingenuouſly aſhamed in the ſenſe of their former ſinfulneſs, which made them unworthy of ſuch favour, yea worthy to have been Children of wrath for ever: The Fathers lips were no ſooner off from them of the returning Prodigal, but the firſt words he utters are, <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> Luk. 15.20 21. And this confeſſion was a great part of his gratitude, and ſo taken by his Father; for this interrupts not their feaſting and rejoycing together. This ingenuity is an effect of this aſſured reconciliation, as 'tis in <hi>Ezek</hi> 16.62, 63. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I Jehovah</hi> (viz. <hi>gracious and

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. By reaſon of this Teſtimony the little Children have a great deal of conſidence and boldneſs towards and with God. <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, we have confidence towards God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.21. but how much more when by the Spirit which he hath given us we know that he dwelleth in us and we in him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. This is the perfecting of love (<hi>viz.</hi> aſſurance is) love with us made perfect, which gives us not only a boldneſs at the throne of Grace, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21, 22. with 5.14, 15. but in the day of Judgement, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.17. for there is no fear in love (thus made perfect) but it caſteth out fear, and fills with confidence and boldneſs, familiarity and freedom.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The little Children having received this Teſtimony long exceedingly to be with their Father; not only to have their affections and converſations in Heaven, but to be perſonally there. Few Saints are willing to die that are but Babes and know not the Father; and I fear if God ſhould not take them to Heaven before they were willing and deſirous to die, I ſay I doubt that Heaven would be very thinly peopled, as to that ſort of his people. But when they have got aſſurance that God is and Heaven ſhall be theirs, they ſing their <hi>nune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittis</hi> with the reverend good old man <hi>(Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon) Now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in

<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.13, 14.</note> the firſt-fruits and earneſt of happineſs) do ſigh and groan and long, yea and think it long till they be ſet free, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. While here they are abſent from the Lord, and 'tis not without ſelf-denial that they are willing to ſtay here: but while they muſt be here, they are hugely ambitious to be acceptable to God, as 'tis 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. and to ſerve the Churches good, as 'tis <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23, 24. They are ſure that though they ſuffer with Chriſt yet they ſhall be glorified together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 17. and therefore they would (as they are bid) haſten his coming, and Pray, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly:</hi> And ſurely might they have their wiſhes, either Chriſt ſhould come to them, or they would go to Chriſt within a very little while. But yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that they are not their own, and that they ſerve not God only for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but his glory; they are made willing to wait <hi>all the daies of their appointed time</hi> (though it be a warfare, as 'tis in that Text in <hi>Job) till their change come, Rom.</hi> 8.23, 24, 25. As much as they long to be at home, they would make no more haſt than good-ſpeed. This much of the firſt thing. The ſecond follows.</p>

                  <head>SECT. 4. <hi>Shewing how the Teſtimony of the Spirit may be diſtinguiſhed from deluſions of Satan, and the preſumptions of our own hearts.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT may be ſome or other may be yet fearful and ſuſpicious leſt they ſhould miſtake and be deceived; and ſo meet with the true miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of falſe joyes: 'tis all one to the Devil which way any go to Hell ſo they go there; whether through the common road and dirty high-way of prophaneneſs, immorality and irreligion, or through the Fields and pleaſant walks of a Form of godlineſs, which hath its Joys, Raptures, Tranſports and Ecſtaſies too; for the evil ſpirit doth ape the good one, and that he may the more facilely and undiſcernably deceive, he puts on the garb of an Angel of Light. How therefore ſhall we diſcern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Teſtimony, which we think we have, be ſound and good or but feigned and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit? I confeſs 'tis good to watch and be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect. becauſe of our adverſary the Devil, who is ſeldom more our adverſary than when he pretends to be our friend, as he did to <hi>Eve</hi> and to Chriſt himſelf; but yet they that have the Teſtimony of Gods Spirit are ſecure and ſafe, though they that have it not cannot be ſo, what ever preſuming confidences they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain themſelves with. I ſhall therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:43845:142"/>to clear this thing, that none may be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, or Satan, or their own hearts. In relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereunto I ſhall lay down three Rules, to which though I purpoſe not to ſpeak much, yet I hope to ſpeak much to the purpoſe; having firſt premiſed this one thing; that they cannot have the witneſs who have not the work of the Spirit; and conſequently they cannot have the witneſs of the Spirit, who have not the witneſs of their own ſpirit, or the Teſtimony of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: for if our hearts condemn us (upon juſt grounds, and we do not bear falſe witneſs againſt our ſelves, which is the ſin of many an otherwiſe tender-hearted Chriſtian) I ſay, if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts; but here begins our confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, if our hearts condemn us not: if we love not in word or tongue, but in deed and in truth, hereby we do (in part) know that we are of the truth, and ſhall aſſure (or as 'tis in the Margent, perſwade) our hearts before him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18,—21. And the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. that <hi>the Spirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ears witneſs with our ſpirit;</hi> as alſo it follows, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. we may have ours without that, but not that without our own; and therefore to make up the full and compleat Teſtimony, both witneſſes (both Spirits) muſt concur and agree without contradicting or thwarting one another: The three that bear witneſs on Earth agree in one, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8. And now to the Rules for diſcerning the difference between
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:43845:143"/>the true and the pretended or preſumed witneſs the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The Rules are theſe three: 1. The witneſs is known from the Rule by which it ſpeaks. 2. By the ground on which it ſpeaks. 3. By the end to and for which it ſpeaks. I ſay 'tis known,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the Rule according to which it ſpeaks: To the Law and to the Teſtimony, for if they ſpeak not according to this Word, there is no light in them (<hi>Hebr.</hi> no morning in them) no, not ſo much as the dawning of the day, or the eye-lids of the morning, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1,—6. and Epiſtle 2.7,—10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6,—9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1,—4. The Spirit of God acts and walks by the ſame Rule that we are to act and walk by, and that's the <hi>Word.</hi> If the Word and Spirit do not agree, we muſt queſtion either whether the Word be of God, or whether the Spirit be of God? and we are at a rueful loſs if they do not both agree; for if the Word ſay one thing and the Spirit another, how ſhall we reconcile it? but Gods Word and Gods Spirit do alwaies agree, and are of one and the ſame mind. The Spirit of God did indite and dictate the holy Scriptures, and therefore it cannot ſay one thing there, and another in thine heart; that were to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt it ſelf: and if its Kingdom be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided how can it ſtand? This concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is infallibly true, that when and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Spirit of God doth bear and give its Teſtimony, 'tis alwaies according to the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, contained in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:43845:143"/>this is the foundation upon which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> builds, both us and its Teſtimony, <hi>Epb.</hi> 2.18,—22. The Spirit of God (as was hinted) did indite and dictate the Scripture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14,—17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20,—27. which unction refers to and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they had heard from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. ſo that they were taught the ſame thing by the unction within, as they were by the word (called unction alſo) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. In all times the Word was the Rule of tryal. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf oppoſed and conquered the Devil by this Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God. He proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Meſſiah more by the Scriptures, than by Miracles; and tells them that if the Scriptures did not teſtifie of him, they ſhould not believe him, and therefore bids them <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, Joh.</hi> 5.39. Our Saviour confutes the errors of the Phariſees and the Sadduces by Scripture. He tells us that his Spirit ſhall not bring us a new Doctrine, but make Application of what he had taught, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. The Apoſtles commended them of <hi>Beroea,</hi> that they ſearcht the Scriptures to ſee if the Apoſtles ſpake true, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.10, 11. And <hi>Peter</hi> prefers it to the <hi>(Bath c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So then upon the whole 'tis clear that what is not according to the Sacred Scriptures, cannot be the witneſs of Gods Spirit.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="2">2. THE witneſs of the Spirit is known from any other by the grounds on which it witneſſeth; of which I ſhall name but two. 1. The Spirit finds this ground-work laid that thou art new-born, though but a Babe or Infant of daies and experience: this alwaies precedes the witneſs. The Spirit doth not nor can bear witneſs to them that are dead, <hi>i. e.</hi> that live in ſins, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. nor to them that have but a form of Godlineſs, or are Phariſees-hypocrites, that they are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God: It cannot witneſs that to be which is not. 'Tis when and becauſe ye are Sons that <hi>God ſends forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father;</hi> and ſo thereupon or therewith <hi>beareth witneſs</hi> to and <hi>with our ſpirits, that we are the Children of God,</hi> Gal. 4.6. with Rom. 8.15, 16. The work is alwaies begun before the witneſs come; that which is not wrought cannot be witneſſed to: If thou therefore be not new-born, thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving thy ſelf to be a Child of God is a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not the witneſs of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God bears witneſs that a man is the Child of God, not upon the ground or account of works and ſelf-righteouſneſs, but upon the ſcore of mercy and grace through the redemption which is by Chriſt Jeſus. It witneſſeth upon the account of mercy not of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:43845:144"/>merit. Though there be a work wrought and working too, yet the witneſs attributes this to (and ſo witneſſeth to it) as of grace. The Sons of God are and their ſalvation is not of works but of grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1,—16. and 9.15, 16. and 11.5, 6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. by all which it doth appear, that all is of grace, and on this bottom and fondation is the witneſs laid and born to it. 'Tis called ſonlſhip by Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which is meerly of grace, all Adoption is ſo) and 'tis to this as ſuch, that the Spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. It beareth witneſs that we are the Children of God, but ſtill that we are ſo by Adoption, and not by nature; for ſo we are Children of wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. and as to works, we were Children of diſobedience, and enemies in our minds by wicked works, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. And as to works wrought by us after the new birth, we are not the Children of God by them, for they are from our being firſt the Children of God, and that not from our worth or will, but his grace and good will: to this and to nothing but this and on this account doth the Spirit bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And this much of the ſecond Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> the ground on which it witneſſeth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The witneſs of the Spirit is known by the ends it aims at and attains (by affecting them) when it beareth witneſs: what they are I have declared in part before, and ſhall ſhew more hereafter, and therefore content my ſelf with but hinting a few things here. The deſign of the Spirit is the abaſing of us, and the exalting
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:43845:145"/>of the Fathers and the Sons love, the Fathers grace and the Sons righteouſneſs in our eyes; that we may be nothing, that God and Chriſt may be all in all: that we may admire the God of all grace &amp; glorifie his Son Jeſus for ever and for ever. The beſt admirations are thoſe which ſpring from knowledge and aſſurance; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the Mother of but ſaint, languid &amp; pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous devotion, but that which flows from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ſtrong and vigorous: and therefore doth the Spirit bear witneſs, that our admirations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions and adorations may be ſuch. 'Tis to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear God to us that we may love him the more and ſerve him the better; that he may be not only the dearer for his mercy, but dearer than it, and we may live to the praiſe and glory of God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, in this preſent world, that is, all the daies of our life, yea and that to come too in Eternity. I might add, that this witneſs deſigns to wean us from this world; that we may put the ſcorn upon the luſt of the eye and fleſh and pride of life, and live above (above the grandeur and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, pride and pomp, pleaſures and pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this world) I ſay that we might live above where the way of life is to them that are wiſe; ſo wiſe, as to have their affections and converſations in Heaven. Thus it follows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Text, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. where he beſpeaks the Fathers, Young men, and little Children, <hi>Not to love the world, neither the things that are in the world,</hi> upon this very account that <hi>if any man love the world, the love</hi> (included in the knowledge) <hi>of the Father is not in him:</hi>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:43845:145"/>he doth not know the Father. So that if any conceit themſelves to be Children of God, and yet admire themſelves, grow proud, wanton and worldly minded, they deceive themſelves, for they have not the witneſs of, nor this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Spirit. Gods Children are of another world while in this, and they that know him to be their Father, live like men of another world in this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13,—16. And hence there is fair way made for me to paſs on to the third part of this diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew more at large the reſult of this knowing the Father (or that by the witneſs of the Spirit, they are the Children of God) as to the priviledges and the injoyments of this attainment of the little Children.</p>

                  <p>HOw upon having received the witneſs of the Spirit, they do triumph over the Law, Sin, the world and preſent enjoyments, I have declared long ſince in a little ſhort Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in Print, called the <hi>Triumph of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> being an Appendix to the firſt part of my <hi>Orthodox Paradoxes;</hi> to which I refer the Reader, and proceed to diſcover other the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and enjoyments of theſe aſſured ones. Which priviledges muſt be more than ordinary or common, becauſe to know the Father is more than common knowledge; and the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent the knowledge, the more excellent the enjoyment is, whether it be in kind or but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in degree. That which I ſhall chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in is the great priviledge, dignity and honour of being able to cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> by the Spirit of Adoption received into and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing in our ſelves: not barely Adoption, nor only the Spirit of Adoption, but by it to cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> is the great thing I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14.15, 16. compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1,—7. Now,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43845:146"/>whether the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> be the ſame thing with the witneſs of the Spirit, whereby we know the Father, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we are his Children, or ſomething precedaneous to it, or ſomething ſucceeding it, and following thereupon, is a great queſtion: in ſo critical and nice a thing we need be wary and cautious. Yet with all humble ſubmiſſion I ſhall ſpeak what I think to be moſt clear and evident in this caſe; which I ſuppoſe to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Spirit of Adoption may in part, and a little precede the witneſs of the Spirit, as the dawning of the day doth the Suns riſing to our view; withall, that more of it may come and appear toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the witneſs; but eſpecially and chiefely that moſt of all (as to exerciſe, uſe and comfort) doth flow from the witneſs after the receit thereof; that is, the Children of God who are led by the Spirit, do act moſt in and by the Spirit of Adoption crying, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> after they have received the witneſs of the Spirit, whereby they know the Father and that they are his Children. For the better clearing hereof, I ſhall (from comparing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.) lay down ſeveral gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual poſitions, all which (well conſidered) will not a little contribute to the deciding of the queſtion according to what I have already hinted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poſition</hi> 1. Theſe Texts (with ſeveral others) do diſcover the great advantage and dignity of the Goſpel ſtate beyond that of the Law; under the Law they were Sons and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43845:147"/>Heirs, but under age, <hi>i. e.</hi> Babes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. The Heir as long as he is a Babe (ſo the Word is) and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. So we, while we were Babes (ſo the word is there alſo, which we render Children) yea they were Sons by Adoption, or by grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.11. for none have been the Sons of God any other way ſince the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> But under the Law, they were under a Spirit of bondage more than of Adoption; and differed not from ſervants, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. were under bondage, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. and received not the Spirit of Adoption till the redemption by Chriſt was over, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4, 5. and till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the filiation or Son ſhip by Adoption (thus manifeſted) they had not the Spirit of the Son, crying, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Verſ. 6. and after this they ceaſed to be ſervants, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. that is, they ceaſed to be Sons and Heirs as Babes only, which <hi>differeth nothing from a Servant,</hi> Verſ. 1. and became Sons and Heirs of God through Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. from 23. to the end. The ſtate under the Law was a Law of bondage; the Law is called, <hi>A yoke of bondage,</hi> Gal. 5.1. and they under it were under a ſpirit of bondage, which (in the genuine and proper ſenſe of it) is a weak, ſlaviſh and cowardly ſpirit of fear, oppoſed to that of power, love and a ſound mind, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. This ſpirit of bondage is uſually interpreted to ſignifie a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh frame of heart, whereby the Jews (like ſlaves and ſuperſtitious perſons) did ſerve God out of fear, and this I ſhall not deny; their religion at the beſt was called, <hi>The fear of the Lord:</hi> yet I ſhall add this unto it, that they
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:43845:147"/>did ſerve God not only from fear, or out of fear, but that they were afraid and under bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage though they did ſerve God; their ſervice did not free them from fear. They were afraid of ſuffering Death and Hell, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Services and Sacrifices, for Jeſus Chriſt took fleſh to free from this fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. and inſtead of it, to bring in the Spirit of Adoption, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. and ſo 'tis ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. to bear them up againſt ſufferings which they were under, as appears by <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15,—18. and accordingly 'tis mentioned to encourage <hi>Timothy</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding others <hi>(Pauls)</hi> or his own ſuffering, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7, 8. And 'tis obſervable that ſince the death of Chriſt and the pouring out of this Spirit, the Saints (many of them) have been as deſirous to die, as before (under the Law) they were (moſt of them) afraid or loth to die. Well then in the general the Goſpel ſtate is as far advanced beyond that of the Law, as liberty is beyond bondage, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage beyond fear, as to them that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not ſimply the Adoption but the Spirit of it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Poſition</hi> 2. THE Spirit of Adoption is an addition, a ſuperaddition to Son-ſhip; under the Law they were ſervant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but now they are Son-ſervants, they have the Spirit of Sons: ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Now ye
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:43845:148"/>are no more Servants but Sons,</hi> viz. you that have received the Spirit of his Son, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6, 7. They are Sons (as all Babes are) before they have this Spirit of Sons, to cry, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> Indeed when God is pleaſed to tranſlate a Babe into an higher Form and to place him among the little Children, this Spirit of Sonſhip or Adoption doth begin to exert it ſelf, before it have a clear and full witneſs thereof; but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily as among the ſtate of Babes, though they be Sons, yet there's little of the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but much of bondage appears in them: ſo that the Spirit of Sons is an addition to Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. they received the filiation and Adoption, and after that the Spirit, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. and ſo by degrees they came to call, <hi>Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. they are called the Sons of God, and upon being Sons, received the Spirit of Sons or of Adoption, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. they were Sons before they could call <hi>Father,</hi> which they could not do, but by the Spirit of Sons, or of Adoption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poſition</hi> 3. The witneſs of the Spirit of God comes upon (not barely the ſon-ſhip or Adoption, but) the Spirit of Adoption; for it bears witneſs with our Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> them of Adoption: for our natural Spirit doth not bear witneſs that we are the Children of God, 'tis our Spirit of Adoption doth that, and with and thereunto doth the Spirit of God bear witneſs. The Babes are Sons, but have not the ſpirit of Sons, and therefore have not the witneſs of Gods Spirit, or aſſurance; but aſſoon as the Spirit of Sons begins to put it ſelf forth, then
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:43845:148"/>uſually doth the witneſs of the Spirit joyn it ſelf to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poſition</hi> 4. Upon the witneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (which gives aſſurance that they are the Children of God, which was doubtful before, becauſe they had only the ſingle witneſs of their own ſpirit, and yet that left them not without hope) I ſay then, doth ſuch a ſoul cry out aloud, with freedom and boldneſs, <hi>My Father, my Father, Abba Father:</hi> it might hope this before and faintly and brokenly indeavour to li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>p out <hi>Father</hi> before, but now it opens its mouth wide and ſpeaks, <hi>My Father.</hi> 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable that the Spirit of Adoption <hi>whereby we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y, Abba Father,</hi> is called the Spirit of <hi>his</hi> Son, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. ſuch as was in Chriſt, who did (but once, <hi>My God, my God</hi>) alwaies pray to God with the Appellation of Father, and once, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Mark 14.36. and all theſe after he had received the witneſs of the Spirit, that be was the only and beloved Son of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. So, when we have the witneſs, we do not only think or hope that God is our Father, but with confidence and aſſurance (a Plerophorie) of Faith we draw near to God, and cry, <hi>Abba Father;</hi> which we cannot ſo freely do before we have the knowledge of the Father to be ours, and that we are his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. So then the Spirit of Sons, and the witneſs of the Spirit of God therewith is (not the Babes, or Servants, but) the Childs por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (and their that are above their Form, <hi>viz.</hi> the Young men and Fathers) and hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth they are taken from being Servants into
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:43845:149"/>the glorious and noble liberty of the Children and friends of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9.</p>

To have the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and the witneſs of the Spirit thereunto) <hi>whereby we cry, Abba Father,</hi> is a choice and tranſcendent priviledge; to have the Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on barely, ſeems, I conſeſs, to be an advance beyond their Son-ſhip under the Law, as 'tis <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5.

                  <p>THat to know the Father (as I have ſpoken of it) is a great attainment and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous priviledge, will be evident by theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſiderations, or conſiderable proofs: to begin with the Old Teſtament. 'Tis Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of in the Old as the glory of the New Teſtament; The Prophecies of the time (and world to come, the Meſſiah or Goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation) were glorious far beyond their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent injoyments; and the Prophets were more <hi>Seers,</hi> in reſpect of what was to be, than of what was; ſo the Apoſtle tells us expreſly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10,—12. and when the day dawns and the day-ſtar ariſeth in our hearts, it ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedes the Prophecis, they being then know in accompliſhments; ſo that we may ſay with a little alteration, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.39,—42. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny believed becauſe of the Prophecies which teſtified of theſe things, but more believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his own word; and now they may ſay, We believe not (only) becauſe of their ſayings, but becauſe we have heard (and ſelt him our ſelves, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1,—3.) and know that this is indeed the Spirit of <hi>his</hi> Son, which beareth witneſs with our Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now, among many other Prophecies of the glorys of the Goſpel-Saints, this is one,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:43845:150"/>that they ſhould know God as a <hi>Father,</hi> and their Father, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26. (which is ſpoken of <hi>David,</hi> and of Chriſt who was more a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> than <hi>David</hi> was) <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, Thou art my Father,</hi> Iſa. 63.16.

'tis ſaid, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people; but if they come out from among them, and be ſeparate and touch not the unclean thing, then I will receive them, and will be a Father to them, and they ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord God Almighty.</hi> God is the God of Angels, but to which of them ſaid he at any time? <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee;</hi> and again, <hi>I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son.</hi> The Apoſtles add this Title to that of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>The God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> from whence 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that 'tis fuller of ſweetneſs that God is <hi>Our Father,</hi> than if he were only our God.</p>
                  <p>The great (if not the greateſt) diſcovery which Chriſt promiſed to make (by ſending the Spirit to do it) was to make known the Father. They had heard him ſpeak much of the Father and of knowing the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1,—7. whereupon ſaith <hi>Philip, Shew us
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:43845:150"/>the Father and it ſufficeth us,</hi> Verſ. 8. from whence our Saviour takes an occaſion to ſpeak more at large of the union that was between him and the Father, and that in knowing him they might know the Father alſo, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever loves him ſhall be loved of the Father, and that the Father would ſend the Holy Ghoſt to be the Comforter, under which name he had not yet been (at leaſt not ſo clearly and fully) known; and that therefore they ſhould rejoyce becauſe he went to the Father; with many other ſuch like ſweet things in that Chapter. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.25. <hi>The time cometh</hi> (viz. when the Comforter cometh) <hi>that I will ſhew you plainly of the Father,</hi> and in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26, 27. places more comfort in it than in his own interceſſion for us, which yet is one of the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts we have, as may be ſeen in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. Accordingly the good news which he ſent his Diſciples after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was this, that he was aſcending to his God and their God; and not only ſo, but to his Father and their Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17. To have the witneſs of the Spirit, and ſo to know the Father, is ſuch another honour as was confer'd on Chriſt himſelf; as the Spirit is the Spirit of his Son, ſo the glory is the glory of his Son, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as he had, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. and 17.5. which voice and teſtimony is called a receiving honour and glory from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. And when the like Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is born by the Spirit of God to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, we receive honour and glory from God the Father: For if it be ſo great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:43845:151"/>to be known of God, how much is it to know him, and to know him as our Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11, 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. By all theſe things it appears that it is a great, glorious and ſweet priviledge to know the Father by the witneſs of his Spirit.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE ſecond thing I am obliged to diſcover and to treat of is, the glory and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his priviledge that the little Children can cry, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> And it lies much in two things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they have a great deal of freedom, boldneſs and aſſurance in their addreſſes to God and appearings before him at the Throne of Grace, and in the day of Judgement. That they have at the throne of Grace, is expreſs upon the account of their Interceſſor and High-Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14,—16. And indeed the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit becomes a Spirit of Prayer (an Interceſſor) in them, as it follows, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. The Spirits knowledge is more to their advantage and comfort, than their ignorance is to their detriment. They go to God as to a Father, as Children uſe to do to their Fathers, but with a <hi>much more</hi> aſſurance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.11. as the Prayers of Chriſt are heard alwaies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.41, 42. and by his Prayers he can obtain and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:43845:151"/>do mighty things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.53. becauſe they are addreſt to his Father; ſo 'tis alſo with theſe that know the Father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21, 22. and 5, 14, 15. God alwaies had his favorites, who had his ear and heart and hand (to command almoſt) for his Sons and Daughters, ſuch were <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Joh, Moſes, J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſhuah</hi> and <hi>Samuel, Abraham, Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. And now theſe little Children (the <hi>Johns</hi> that lie in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.21,—26.) are ſuch as they, <hi>viz.</hi> great prevailers with and obtainers from the Lord, as our Saviour tells them and us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.12, 13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.7. and 16.23.24. all which places and promiſes refer to what they ſhould ask and receive and do after he was aſcended, and had ſent the Spirit to make known the Father to them. As they have great boldneſs at the throne of Grace, ſo in the day of Judgement alſo; for perfect love (a Pierophorie or full aſſurance) hath boldneſs in the day of Judgement, becauſe as he is, ſo theſe are in this world (<hi>viz.</hi> he is declared and witneſſed to be the Son, and theſe are to be the Sons of God) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17. they ſhall have confidence at his coming, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The advantage of knowing the Father and being able to cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> is much in this, that 'tis a great relief to them in the ſaddeſt times and conditions: 'Twas Chriſts ſtanding conſolation that God was his Father, and ſo 'tis theirs. It's ſufficient to now the Father, who is all-ſufficient, and whoſe grace ſhall be ſufficient for them, come what will or can. This is great and ſtrong conſolation,</p>

I ſhould now come to apply the whole, but that there is one Queſtion which will require an Anſwer to it before I ſhew the uſes of this Point.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion is, <hi>Whether thoſe that have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance do alwaies, to their dying day, lie in the injoyment and powerful influences of this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? may not this Sun be Eclipſed? May not this Child of light walk in darkneſs, after the light and ſight of God as a Father? May not the witneſs of the Spirit be ſuſpended and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, 1. Some of them may and do live in a continual injoyment of their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. eſpecially if they be grown up to be Fathers (after they have been Young-men conquerors) for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are ſpoken of as perſons, who have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, known him, that is, from the beginning; and theſe little Children (ſuch as are to be kept in this ſtate) may alſo (as <hi>John</hi> did) lie in the boſom to the very laſt: but if any of them be (and many of them are) deſign'd to be young men, then indeed they are tempted to call their Son-ſhip into queſtion,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:43845:157"/>but by the word and witneſs abiding in them (like <hi>Joſephs</hi> bow in ſtrength) they overcome and conquer, as Chriſt Jeſus did; which will appear in treating of the next degree or Claſſis, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Young-men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the influence of aſſurance in reſpect of joy, rapture, tranſport and the like, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive that it doth not abide with any in ſo high a degree and great a meaſure as when it came at firſt: my reaſon is this, their Spirit would fail, for the viſion is too ſtrong, and the light too glaring and bright to be born alwaies or long as it ſhined at firſt, and may now and then at ſome certain ſeaſons afterward; beſide if it ſhould continue long, as it ſeiz'd them at firſt and for a while, they would be unfit for any of theſe lower offices and affairs of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular calling, wherein they are to ſerve the Will of God in their generations; for this would ſo poſſeſs and take them up (as the Prophets of old were during the time of their Viſions) that they could not attend any thing elſe. As when wrath is upon any, the Spirit would fail if God ſhould ſo contend for ever, as 'tis in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16,—18. So indeed if God ſhould continue the bright ſhine of glory alwaies, as 'tis when the aſſurance comes at firſt, they would faint under ſo great a weight of Glory, and beg God to forbear a little, leſt their ſpirit ſhould fail. Now as wrath due to ſin is not alwaies apprehended as at the firſt conviction, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may love be; and yet the influence of this Sun may operate much when the Clouds inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and accordingly the little Children (during
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43845:158"/>their abode in that ſtate) have a ſedate peace and calm ſerenity poſſeſt by them for the moſt part, and ſo can go on cheerfully to ſerve their God and Father, and to accept of and be pleaſed with his Will in all conditions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They having received the witneſs of the Spirit, this Spirit never witneſſeth againſt them to deny or contradict the former witneſs: it never revokes it, though it ſhould ſuſpend it; nor reverſeth it, though it ſhould witneſs better things againſt them. For though it never do ſay to ſuch a ſoul, Thou art a Child of wrath, yet poſſibly in a time of deſertion and darkneſs it may ſay, Thou art under wrath; and ſo ſet home very terrible things to the great affliction and deep humbling of the Soul. And thus at length have I diſpatcht not all that I might, but all that I deſigned to ſpeak as to the doctrinal part of this diſcourſe about the little Childrens (attainment, injoyment, diſpoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as 'tis in and from) knowing the Father, <hi>viz.</hi> as their Father.

               <p>But to keep cloſe to the word and thing, I ſhall ſpeak of this their being ſtrong, as it notes the ſtrength preceding the Victory, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they overcome, and not that which ſucceeds to and abides after their conqueſt and victory. <hi>Ye are ſtrong, i. e.</hi> ye are mighty and were ſo before the diſpute and fight (as well as after) or elſe you had not overcome. The ſtrength of the Young men notes and denominates them to be men of might and valour, men fit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:43845:169"/>labour and to endure hardſhip, as the good Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt: and according to this notion you ſhall find that in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the hardeſt and moſt difficult employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been aſſigned to and performed by Young men, becauſe they are ſtrong and fit for ſuch ſervice, <hi>The glory of young men is their ſtrength,</hi> Prov. 20.29. 'tis thus remarqued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 Kings 11.28. <hi>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon ſeeing the young man that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious</hi> (Hebr. that he did work) <hi>he made him Ruler over all the charge</hi> (Hebr. burthen) <hi>of the houſe of Joſeph:</hi> here is might, valour, work and burden-bearing ſpoken of this Young man. In 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1,—5. ſtrength, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during hardſhip and being a good Souldier are joyn'd all together. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> ſent young men to ſpy out the Land, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.23. The Porters mentioned in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.6,—8. are ſaid to be mighty men of valour, ſtrong men, able men for ſtrength for the ſervice. Now as 'tis naturally, 'tis alſo morally the glory of Young men that they are ſtrong. But the Queſtion is,</p>
               <p>Wherein their Strength doth lie?</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid of <hi>Sampſon</hi> that his ſtrength was in his Hair; and of the <hi>Bohemoth</hi> that his ſtrength is in his Loyns, and his force in the Navel of his Belly, <hi>Job</hi> 40.16. but wherein is the ſtrength of theſe Young men? 'Tis originally in the Lord and the power of his might, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10. or the grace which is in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. 'tis not the grace that is in us, but that which is in him that is ſufficient
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:43845:170"/>for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. and 'tis of his ſulneſs that we receive grace for grace, as we have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to uſe it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. God hath laid our help on him who is mighty to ſave, and who goeth forth conquering and to conquer till all his enemies be made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, and ſubdued under his feet. But among and above all the grace communicated to them, their ſtrength is in Faith or in believing, for this is the victory whereby we overcome the world even our Faith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4, 5. and as hereby we overcome the world, ſo him alſo who is in the world, that is, the Devil; and therefore though every piece of Gods Armour be of great uſe, yet we are adviſed above all to take the Shield of Faith, whereby we quench the fiery darts of the Devil, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11,—16. <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſtrong in Faith: and in the ſtrength of Faith did <hi>David</hi> encounter <hi>Goliah</hi> (a type of the Devil) and 'twas by Faith that the Heroes mentioned in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. wrought ſuch wonders and obtained victories, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 32,—34. ſo that theſe young men are ſtrong in the Lord, ſtrong in the Faith that is in them, they go out in his name and do prevail; 'tis not in their own but his ſtrength, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. for 'tis not they of themſelves do conquer, but he that liveth in them by Faith that makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. Theſe Young men are Chriſts Armour-bearers and they ſlay after him, as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Jnathan's,</hi> 1 Sam. 14.13. 'Tis Jeſus Chriſt who teacheth their hands to War, and their fingers to fight, ſo that the Devils bow of ſteel is broken by them,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:43845:170"/>and they believe down the Devil under their feet.</p>
               <p>Through the ſtrength of Chriſt living in them by Faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16, 17. they are (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt omnipotent, for they are) able to do all things, not only to abound, but to be abaſed and to endure hardſhip, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11,—13; and by the power of his might all things are poſſible to them. <hi>Abraham</hi> conquered doubts, fears, yea and naturally impoſſible things by ſtrength of Faith; he could live by Faith when his own body and <hi>Sarahs</hi> Womb were dead; the things which croſt and bound up his hope were no more to him, than new Ropes and green Withs (<hi>viz.</hi> the ſtrongeſt) were to <hi>Sampſon</hi> before his Hair was ſhaved, and his ſtrength (even God) departed from him. By this ſtrength <hi>Jacob</hi> prevail'd with God and had his new name from thence, <hi>Iſrael</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailer with God. 'Tis by this ſtrength that the Young men overcome the evil one, and every one of his evils, for ſo his temptations are called, and the day of temptation is called, <hi>The evil day,</hi> Epheſ. 6.13. <hi>Be ſtrong,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>in the grace</hi> (or that grace) <hi>which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.1. Now it may well refer to Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus, for though it (as all other graces) be from him, yet this is in him (we believe in him) and accordingly the ſame Apoſtle bids the ſame <hi>Timothy</hi> fight the good fight of Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12.</p>
               <p>Faith is the Armour of proof againſt the Devils darts, as was hinted but lately: and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:43845:171"/>if we will reſiſt the Devil ſo that he may flee from us, it muſt be by being ſtedfaſt in the Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8, 9. Though the Devil roar moſt dreadfully like a Lyon, yet a ſtrong and ſtedfaſt Faith will make this King of terrours to run away. And therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. Watch ye, ſtand ſaſt in the Faith, quit ye like men, be ſtrong (all Military Terms and fitted for theſe Young men) quit ye like men, <hi>i. e.</hi> like Young men Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, likemen of War; and that you may ſo do, ſtand faſt in the Faith, be ſtrong in Faith. Look to Jeſus then the Captain and bringer up alſo of our Faith, he hath conquered the Devil, be you his Armour-bearers and ſlay after him, by Faith following him your Leader, and as he did you alſo ſhall (if ye be Young men) overcome the evil one. But before I ſhew who this evil one is, and what 'tis to conquer him, I am ingaged to ſhew where and whence theſe young men have their ſtrength in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Text, and that is by the Word of God abiding in them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>How they come by this Strength.</hi> viz. <hi>By the Word of God abiding in them.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE next thing which is aſſerted concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Young men, is, That the Word of God abideth in them; which may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as ſpoken after as the ſign, or as ſpoken before as a means or cauſe of the victory: as it refers to that, it imports that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fight, yet their bow (like <hi>Joſephs</hi>) abode in ſtrength, and that they were not weakened by the hot and ſharp diſpute which they had with the Devil; but in this ſenſe I ſhall not handle it here, though I may touch it anon. As it refers to this (and I ſuppoſe it moſt properly doth) it ſhews us by what they were ſtrengthened to overcome; for if the Word of God had not abode with them, they had not been ſtrong enough to overcome the evil one: the weapon by which the Young men overcome him is the ſword of the Spirit, the Word of God; or that by which the Young men are made ſo ſtrong as to overcome the wicked one thereby, is the Word of God abiding in them. As their enemies are not carnal only, but ſpiritual, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. ſo
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:43845:172"/>their weapons are not at all carnal but ſpiritual, and ſo mighty through God, 2. <hi>Cor</hi> 10.4, 5. There are two Queſtions to be propoſed and reſolved in relation hereunto: 1. What is meant by the Word of God. 2. What by the abiding of the Word of God in them, for 'tis not the Word of God in their hand, but in their heart, and not ſojourning, or lodging, but dwelling there.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is meant by the Word of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the general, by the Word of God we are to underſtand the Mind and Will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd and made known in the holy Scriptures (which are ſo often called the Oracles, Speeches, Word or ſpeaking of God) as held forth in the Doctrines, Prophecies, Promiſes and Precepts thereof; but eſpecially as 'tis written in their hearts and imprinted there, according to the New Covenant. This Word of God in whole and in every part is hugely uſeful for inlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, comſorting and ſtrengthening that we may overcome the wicked one: 'tis to make the man of God perfect, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. 'tis the ſword of the Spirit, of which we may ſay (as <hi>David</hi> of another material one) there is none like it; for by it Chriſt himſelf overcame the wicked one. Yet more particularly, this may refer</p>
               <p n="1">1. To Chriſt himſelf who is the original Word of God the Father, by which or whom he made the World and hath ſpoken to the World by Word of mouth (as I may ſpeak) not by piece-meal and diverſe faſhions or tropes and figures (as of old) but clearly, plainly and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:43845:172"/>fully, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2. Now by Chriſt Jeſus abiding and dwelling in us are we ſtrong, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. or by the grace that is in him, of which he is full, as before: and without him we can do nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may refer to the promiſes of God which are ſo often called by the name of Word, thy Word, the Word of Promiſe, which is all one with the Word of God; to this <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith did reſer, and wherein he was ſo ſtrong, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. and truly the Word of Promiſe being in and abiding in us doth not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to our ſtrength and victory. By theſe we are not only made partakers of a divine nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. but obliged, aſſiſted and quickened to perfect holineſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. notwithſtanding Temptations from without or within.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the Word of God may here be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, The witneſs of the Spirit bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with their ſpirits, that they are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God: This teſtimony abiding in them (as it did in Chriſt) doth ſtrengthen them to overcome the evil one. When they were lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children they received this Teſtimony, and being now called to the War, this Word as well as Work of God abideth in them and makes them ſtrong to the Battel. So that here is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit (the Word of God in each reſpect) ſtanding by them, and abiding in them, to ſtrengthen them, to deliver them out of the mouth of the Lion, to keep them from every evil work, and to preſerve them to the heavenly Kingdom, to uſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:43845:173"/>experiences and expreſſions recorded in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What is meant by the abiding of Gods Word in them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That it doth not only denote the in-being of the Word (in either of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects forementioned) that there is ſuch a thing there, in their heart and inner man; nor barely the calling in to mind and keeping it in their memory; nor its lodging and ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them as an Inn-mate, no nor as a friend that is to depart: but it notes a ſettled abode or dwelling in efficacious power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Mother and Grandmother that Faith <hi>dwelt</hi> in them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. And when the Apoſtle prays that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> may be ſtrengthened, he joyns this with it, that Chriſt may <hi>dwell</hi> in their hearts by Faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16, 17. And 'tis ſaid of the happy ones, who are reproached for the name of Chriſt, that the Spirit of God and of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth <hi>reſt</hi> upon them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. And our Saviour tells his Diſciples that there is no great things to be done, barely by being in him, unleſs they <hi>abide</hi> in him, and he in them, <hi>John</hi> 15. And the great thing in the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt was, that he ſhould <hi>abide</hi> with them. So that the ſenſe of this expreſſion can ſignifie no leſs than that the Word of God doth remain in them in the fulneſs of aſſurance, joy, and power, by which they are ſtrengthened and inabled to overcome the wicked one; and what he is I am next to diſcover. I might here have
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:43845:173"/>taken occaſion to ſhew how the Word of God, abiding in them doth ſtrengthen their Faith and make them ſtrong; as alſo how their ſtrength of Faith doth contribute to their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements and victory, but I reſerve that to its proper place, and at preſent ſhall proceed, to explain the third thing in the Text which is ſaid of theſe Young men, <hi>viz.</hi> that they have overcome the evil or wicked one. As to this I ſhall have theſe things to treat of, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew what is meant by the evil one; what the diſpute (between the wicked one and the Young men) is about; that the Young men do overcome, and how they do overcome the wicked one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of theſe things I ſhall ſpeak in the Model and order firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, which brings me to the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

It is uſed to denote and ſet out a notorious wicked man that hath no fellow in wickedneſs, a Devil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, an Antichriſt, as 'tis in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3,—9. for though the word (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, all noting a moſt flagitious, profligate and terribly wicked perſon, as this word doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. but it doth moſt uſually refer to the Devil himſelf, who is (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) the wicked one, ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently as none is beſide him; and this may be obſerved to be undoubtedly true by comparing theſe following Texts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19. with

                  <hi>Luke</hi> 8.12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. now this is the evil or wicked one (not excluding others) that theſe Young men have overcome by being ſtrong, and the Word of God abiding in them: The Devil being the Captain-General, the ring-leader, the Maſter of miſrule and miſchief, the reſt fall with him. In telling us that they have overcome the wicked one, 'tis implyed that there was firſt a fight, an hot and ſharp encounter between the Devil and the Young men: the Devil did ſet upon them and tempt them ſhrewdly, and they had not a little to do till they won the field and day of him. And ſurely 'twere not temptations in common but ſome ſingular ones that theſe Young men were under: the Babes meet with common ones, but theſe with ſpecial ones, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. As Chriſt Jeſus would not teach the Babes Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they could not bear, ſo he would not lead them into temptations, which they could not overcome: but theſe Young men, who are his Champions and Worthies, they encounter Giants (as <hi>Davids</hi> did) they war not againſt fleſh and blood (weak enemies) but againſt principalities and powers, <hi>&amp;c.

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>What the diſpute is about, or what the temptations are which Young men do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo and conquer.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT muſt be remembred that theſe Young men are taken out from among the little Children, who have received the witneſs of the Spirit that they are the Children of God; and about this thing is the diſpute between the Devil and them, <hi>viz.</hi> whether they be the Children of God or not: and ſo ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that place (which ſpeaks in Military language as if it properly referred to the ſtate and condition of theſe Young men) <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. reading that which we render in high or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places, about heavenly things, <hi>viz.</hi> our Title to Sonſhip and ſo to Heaven; this is the thing which the Spirit witneſſed to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, this the Devil calls in queſtion and offers arguments againſt it: but all theſe arguments do the Young men overcome by the Word of God abiding in them, which ſtrengthens their Faith to give glory to God and his Spirit as the faithful and true witneſs, notwithſtanding all the cunning inſinuations of wiles and the Devil.</p>
               <p>To clear this up a little more, I humbly offer this to conſideration, That the Saints (mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts body) are all of them more or leſs conformable to his Image, and to the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:43845:175"/>ſeveral ſtates and conditions wherein he was. Now ſuch was the condeſcenſion of our great and good Lord Jeſus, that he not only took fleſh and blood (the humane nature) in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: but was found in our faſhion and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like us in all things, yet ſtill without ſin; he went through all our ſtates; he was once as a Babe, <hi>viz.</hi> made under the Law, and was in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and ſo judged <hi>as</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; withal, he was under Tutors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and was obedient to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.46,—51. where 'tis added that he increaſed in wiſdom as in age, which argues (without any diſparagement) that his attainments (as in the fleſh) were gradual. After a while he (being Baptized and Praying) hath the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from heaven that he was the Son of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.21, 22. and then was Jeſus led up of the ſpirit into the Wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.1. and ſo paſt from the Childs to the Young mans ſtate.</p>
               <p>So then (in conformity hereunto) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and declare that the temptations which the Young men undergo are the ſame (and about the ſame thing) which Jeſus Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent when after the witneſs of the Spirit he was tempted by the Devil. The Spirit firſt witneſſeth, then the Devil calls this into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and puts Chriſt upon the proof, to which Chriſt anſwers and conquers by the Word of God abiding in him; and juſt ſo it was with theſe Young men: the phraſes and things do ſo accord that it ſeems to me to be unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To come up then to what I intend by ſteps
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:43845:176"/>and degrees, The Saints in conformity to Chriſt Jeſus are but Babes at firſt, under the Law; in the likeneſs of ſinners, <hi>as</hi> carnal; and are in ſubjection to Tutors and Governours: after this God is pleaſed to make himſelf known to ſome of them as a Father by the witneſs of his Spirit, and ſo they arrive to the ſtate of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and then God ſingles out ſome of theſe to be tempted of the Devil about their Sonſhip, and they become (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) Young men and brave Souldiers, who are taught to draw and wield the ſword of the Spirit, the Word of God, againſt the Devil, as Chriſt alſo did.</p>
               <p>God was pleaſed to take this care of and about <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Law, That when a man had taken a new Wiſe he ſhould not go out to War, neither ſhould he be charged with any buſineſs, but he ſhould be free at home one year, and cheer himſelf with his Wife, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.5. So by way of alluſion I may ſay that when the Saints marry a new Wife, the Fathers Love, they are often priviledged for ſome time to lie in his boſom and to cheer themſelves with his Love: but then ſome of them are called out to war, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.18,—22. and though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they indure ſome hardſhip for a ſeaſon, yet they become conquerors, which is a greater glory than not to fight at all (as 'tis in ſome ſenſe to conquer death than to be immortal) and in the ſenſe and ſtrength of his Love they go forth conquering and to conquer, and ſo live in the triumph of their aſſurance, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did, and become his Squires or Armor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers fighting under his banner of Love
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:43845:176"/>againſt the evil one, if ever he return again and make new affaults upon them, as he did upon Chriſt himſelf, from whom he departed but for a ſeaſon; but then the after-temptations are of another nature, <hi>viz.</hi> perſecutions and ſufferings, as our Saviours were. Upon the whole I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the temptations of the wicked one which the Young men have overcome, are ſuch as Chriſts were, when tempted of the Devil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the witneſs of the Spirit; which what they were I ſhall briefely examine.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ABout theſe Temptations of Chriſt I have a larger Diſcourſe than I think conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to infert here (which if God pleaſe may come forth by it ſelf in due time) at preſent I ſhall only touch the parallel between Chriſts and the Young mens temptations after the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Fathers Love. The Young men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been proclaimed, as Chriſt was, by a voice like to a ſrumpet from Heaven, which gives a certain ſound, that they are the Sons of God, and Heirs of God and glory; the Devil puts in his exceptions againſt this Title, and would fain have them believe that this is but Enthuſiaſm, a meer fancied and pretended apprehenſion, without any true and juſt ground; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore comes and calls it into queſtion, cavilling (as at firſt) if thou be the Son of God, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:43845:177"/>He labours firſt to make a doubt of it; and if he cannot attain that, he then indeavours to bring them to preſume upon and make bold with it. His firſt deſign is to make it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.3. <hi>If thou be the Son of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that theſe Stones be made bread;</hi> this was after he had faſted forty daies and forty nights and was an hungred. That which he ſlyly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates is this; thou thinkeſt thy ſelf, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pofeſt to have witneſs from Heaven, that thou art the Son of God; but if God were thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and did love thee, would he ſuffer thee to be ſo poor and hungry? and could he find it in his heart to put thee on ſo much hardſhip, as faſting, and ſo long too, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would he let thee be in the Wilderneſs among the Beaſts? Fathers provide for their Children, and if thou wert his Son, ſurely he would maintain thee at a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rate than this, would be not? canſt thou (it being thus with thee) believe thy ſelf to be the Son of God?</p>
                  <p>Accordingly he pleads with and againſt the Children of God, when in a low eſtate in this world: it hath pleaſed God to chuſe many of the poor of this world to be rich in Faith and Heirs of the Kingdom, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. and many of theſe who have this aſſurance are many times hard put to it in the world, and by Satan too becauſe of this their poverty, as if 'twere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the riches of Faith and title of an Heir to a Kingdom: but now as Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and conquered, ſo do they by the Word of God abiding in them. One Anſwer ſerves them both, <hi>viz. Man lives not by Bread</hi> (a mans
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:43845:177"/>life conſiſts not in the abundance of things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd) <hi>but by every</hi> or any <hi>word that cometh out of the mouth of God,</hi> any thing that God ſhall appoint, yea his Word can do it without any thing elſe. Theſe things below are not good enough for Love-tokens, as hatred ſo Love is not known by external low or high conditions: Some may have Bread and no Love; and others Love, though they have no Bread. God can and will provide in due time. And what is't to thee, O Devil, if I am contented with the Will of God,

                     </note> and have meat to eat which thou knoweſt not of! Thus being ſtrong in Faith by the Word of God abiding in them, they overcome the wicked one, and will not queſtion their Sonſhip becauſe they are poor and low brought in this world.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Devils firſt Argument being invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, he takes up another of a far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent aſpect, and would now have Chriſt be as confident and preſuming as before, he would have had him diffident and doubtful; and ſo deals he with the Young men. Saith he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6. <hi>If thou be the Son of God eaſt thy ſelf down</hi> (from the Pinacle) <hi>for it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> That this Promiſe did belong to Chriſt in a ſpecial maner, is undoubtedly true; and the Devil perceiving how precious the written Word of God was to Chriſt Jeſus, he fills his mouth with Scripture and a Promiſe, but leaves out the condition of it to which the protection is annexed; and that which he would cunningly inſinuate amounts to this, <hi>q. d.</hi> If thou be the Son wilt thou not truſt thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers power and promiſe? canſt have better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity than the power of a faithful God, and the Faith of a powerful God? hath he not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thee a Life-guard of Angels to bear thee in their Arms, and wilt be afraid?</p>
                  <p>Thus he often ſets on the Young men; what need you be ſo ſolicitous and concern'd for means, have you not Promiſes of teaching, protection, preſervation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What will you
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:43845:178"/>not truſt your Father and take his Word? But as before, ſo now one Anſwer fits both: 'tis this, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> Indeed to truſt in means is to deſpiſe God, but to neglect means is to tempt God. There is no need of caſting my ſelf down, of making ſuch daring attempts, for there is a way down, and the fartheſt way about is the neareſt way home. <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> i. e. thou ſhalt not go out of his which is thy way, and wherein only is preſervation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. While there is an ordinary appointed way and means, I muſt not attempt nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume on extraordinary; that were to enquire after Signs and Miracles, when there is no need of them, which is no leſs than to tempt God. Thou, O Devil, doſt tempt me to tempt God, which is not the Genius of his Sons to do, though thou wouldſt have me to do it under that name: no Satan no, though thou tempt me I will not the Lord my God by going out of my way and neglecting the means of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>

                  <head>SECT. 3. <hi>A further Continuation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HAving been defeated in the way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, the Devil takes another courſe and falls to offering of terms and making of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains; ſaith he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.9. <hi>All theſe things</hi> (the Kingdoms of the world and the glory of them) <hi>will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> Here are fine and brave things, grandeur and gallantry; pleaſure, prettineſs and pomp; here are the luſts of the eye, the fleſh and the pride of life, the things which the Young men in the world are ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd of even to fondneſs and dotage: theſe are the things which the <hi>Alexanders</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſars</hi> of this world, the <hi>Nimrods</hi> and hunters after glory purſue with might and main ambition; do but fall down and bow the knee to worſhip me, and all ſhall be thine. And this ſeems to be the Devils (<hi>Saera An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chora</hi>) laſt hope, if he cannot prevail this way he deſpairs; he hath choaked many a forward and far-gone Profeſſor (as the thorny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground hearers) with this bit and bait, as he did our firſt Parents even in innocency; and therefore S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>John</hi> immediately after his having ſpoken to the Young men, ſubjoyns this, <hi>Love nor the world nor the things thereof,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.14, 15.</p>
                  <p>But let us hear the Anſwer from the Word of God, written not only in the Bible but in
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:43845:179"/>their hearts; <hi>Then Jeſus</hi> (and the Young man Saint) <hi>ſaith unto him, Get thee hence Satan, for it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> q. d. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters, God and Mammon,</hi> God and the Devil. God is too good a Maſter to be left, and the Devil too bad an one to be ſerved. Get hence vile varlet, wretched cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, thou wicked one! doſt think I will leave Heaven for Hell, God for the Devil, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and glory of God, for the Kingdoms and glory of this world, which <hi>is all but vanity and vexation of Spirit!</hi> Is God and Heaven, and my ſoul no more worth than this! avaunt Devil, get hence for ſhame! doſt think I will fell my Soul for a paultry vanity, and become a Lover of that which will make me the enemy of my God, and make a God of mine enemy; no, no, avoid Satan and get hence.</p>
                  <p>Now after this the Devil leaves him and runs away; he cannot ſtand before the Word of God: if he be reſiſted (by being ſtedfaſt in the Faith) he will flee; and if he flee he is (for the preſent) conquered; and he is put to flight and conquered by the <hi>It is written,</hi> the Word of God abiding in power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Young men; as he was by our Saviour. Thus I have briefely ſhewn the parallel between the temptations which attended Chriſt and which attend the Young men (after the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit concerning their Sonſhip) which are defeated and put to flight by the Word of God. The ſigns of this victory
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:43845:180"/>ſhall be ſhewn openly as in triumph in due time, but at preſent I ſhall ſpeak to one and only to one temptation more, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults ſome of the little Children and the Young men, and then proceed to prove the victory by the ſpoiles which ſhall be brought forth as ſigns thereof.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THere is one Argument which the Devil could not make uſe of againſt Chriſt (who was without ſin) but doth often make uſe of againſt the little Children and Young men too (if poſſible, to) make them call their Sonſhip into queſtion: 'tis that they are not without ſin, but do in many things offend either by doing evil, or omitting good, or by falling ſhort of their duty and giving God the glory due to his name. Thou (ſaith the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil) canſt not be a Child of God, nor know him as a Father, for ſuch do not commit ſin nor can they; do but read 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4-10. and 5.18. and tell me what thou canſt ſay to theſe things? if thou ſay thou ſinneſt not, I will prove it; if thou ſay thou haſt no ſin, thou doſt lie and ſinneſt in ſaying ſo; and if thou ſin, how canſt thou ſay that thou art born of God, when the Scripture ſaith that he who is born of God doth not commit ſin? This is a
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:43845:180"/>two-edged Sword, an Argument that cuts on both ſides; it ſeems to put theſe poor ſouls to a <hi>Dilemma:</hi> but yet by the Word of God abiding in them, they defeat this alſo.</p>
                  <p>To this they Anſwer, 1. By following the example of Chriſt Jeſus in oppoſing truly quoted and rightly underſtood Scripture, to the Scripture which is falſely quoted and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd (which latter is as bad as the former) the Devil wreſts and ſo wrongs the Scripture (and knows it) though it be to his own confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confuſion: they ſay (as our Saviour did) again, It is written, and as the Devil knows that the ſeeming oppoſite Scriptures may be reconciled, ſo he cannot endure that they ſhould be reconciled; he will rather be ſilent and anſwer nothing, as when Chriſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his half quotation by a whole one. Thus then may the Young man Anſwer; Satan, thou knoweſt that <hi>Abraham, Moſes, David,</hi> &amp;c. were born of God and had the witneſs of his Spirit that they were his Children, and yet were not without ſin, but ſinned after their new birth or converſion; and thou knoweſt that if we ſay (the <hi>we</hi> ſpoken of in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verſes, who had fellowſhip with God) if we ſay that we have not ſinned (ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion) we make him a lyar and his Word is not in us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.10. This the Devil ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot or will not reconcile, though he knows 'tis reconcileable with the fore-alledged Texts, and therefore they are miſapplyed as to the caſe in hand and the perſons concern'd in this diſpute. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:43845:181"/> 2. Say the Young men, the Texts which thou haſt quoted, do not ſeem to ſpeak of every or any ſin in any degree, but of a ſpecial Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> hating or not loving of the Brethren, which they that are born of God cannot be guilty of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20. but thou knoweſt, Satan, and that to thy vexation, that I love the Brethren, and am paſt from Death to Life. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſee what's ſaid in the Treatiſe of Babes, in the Chapter of their love to the Brethren. Or elſe it may refer to the ſin unto death, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16, 17, 18. Yet,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Text may not be reſtrain'd to that, I can ſay further that I do not live in ſin nor make a trade of ſin as thou doſt, I am no ſin-maker as thou art: I ſin not as they that are of thee who workeſt in the Children of diſobedience that they may fulfil the luſts and wills of the fleſh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1,—3. and of ſuch (thou canſt not deny but) the quoted Texts do ſpeak.</p>

               <p> To overcome is a word that is uſed in a Forenſick and in a Military ſenſe, as it refers to the Court and to the Camp, 'tis a Law term, and a term of War: in a legal or Court ſenſe, 'tis to overcome by right and juſtification, to be cleared and juſtified as to any charge and indictment laid againſt them; to overcome in a Military ſenſe, is to conquer by might, by dint of Sword; which in the School ſenſe is to overcome by force of Argument. In the firſt ſenſe to be cleared and juſtified is to overcome, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by comparing <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 'tis that thou maiſt be juſtified and cleared, in the <hi>Romans</hi> 'tis that thou maiſt be juſtified and overcome: now in this ſenſe not only the Young men, but all the Saints are conquerors and do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, that is, there is no condemnation but juſtification to and for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. with 33, 34,—38, 39. though they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by men yet juſtified by God, as Chriſt was put to death in the fleſh, but juſtified in and by the Spirit. Though the Devil, accuſe yet Chriſt their Advocate pleads for and to their juſtification; and they are freed <hi>(in foro Dei)</hi> in Gods Court, which is a relieving Chancery againſt the cruel Sentences of Common Law; ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeparates them from the Love of God in Chriſt. To this ſenſe ſpeaks alſo the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18.</p>
               <p>But in the Military ſenſe 'tis that we are moſt ſpecially to underſtand the conqueſt and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:43845:183"/>overcoming ſpoken of theſe Young men in our Text; they have overcome by meer ſtrength of the word and Faith, ſo that they not only overcome him as juſtified from his charge and indictment, but overcome his temptations by dint of Sword, <hi>i. e.</hi> by ſtrength of Argument from the Word abiding in them. If the Devil plead ſin and guilt, they plead Chriſt and his ſatisfaction; if the Devil witneſs againſt them that they are not, they produce the witneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that they are the Children of God, and ſo overcome him. So that the Young-man is a double conqueror, by right and might; by Word and Sword; at the Bar and in the Field; they overcome by ſtrength of Faith or believing in Chriſt, or rather by the ſtrength of Chriſt believed in. But then,</p>
               <p>How and how far have they overcome? the Devil is not ſlain, he is in being ſtill, and hath a power of tempting ſtill; how then is it ſaid, that they <hi>have</hi> overcome the wicked one? may not the Devil rally and recruit again? may he make no more on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets on the Young men? To this ſome make Anſwer thus, that the <hi>Praeter</hi> Tenſe is put for the <hi>Future,</hi> q.d. you ſhall as certainly overcome as if you had overcome: while the Word of God abideth in you, you ſhall never be overcome, and ſo do overcome, and may be ſaid to have overcome. So the called of God are ſaid to be ſaved becauſe they ſhall be ſaved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. So Chriſt is ſaid to have, yea ſaith
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:43845:183"/>that he hath overcome the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. when yet his conqueſt was not compleat till his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, nor is fully and wholly ſo till all his enemies be made his Footſtool. So he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have finiſhed the work thou haſt given me to do,</hi> when as yet he had not died, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he was to obey, having received it from his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. Many other places are ſpoken at this rate to denote the certainty of what ſhall be; 'tis ſaid to be done becauſe it ſhall be done. So ſay they here, the Young men have overcome the wicked one, <hi>i. e.</hi> they are to fight, and though the diſpute be ſo hot and fierce, as that to a ſtander by it may be doubtful, whether the Young men will overcome the Devil, or the Devil them, yet 'tis ſo ſure that they ſhall overcome, that 'tis ſaid they have overcome. But though this be often true and may be admitted as a truth here, yet I doubt not but there is a reality, and not only a figure in the ſpeech, <hi>they have overcome:</hi> they are conquerors and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained victory already.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore ſhew how they may be ſaid to have overcome the wicked one in the Scripture ſenſe as to what is paſt, the incounters that have hitherto been between them. When the Devil is reſiſted he flees, and ſo is for the preſent conquered; as he fled from Chriſt and was conquered as ſo that battel, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. He who attains to do that which he is exhorted to,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:43845:184"/>attains that for which he exhorted to it: ſo that being exhorted to reſiſt the Devil that he may flee, they find that when he is reſiſted he doth flee, and ſo is conquered for that ſeaſon. Beſide, they ſtand and keep their ground, which is a further expreſſion of victory, they not only withſtand, but ſtand, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11,—13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.27. and that this reſiſtance and ſtanding is by Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong in Faith, is clear from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. and thus by reſiſting, ſtanding firm and maintaining their ground, they have hitherto overcome the wicked one.</p>
               <p>The ſumm of it amounts to this, <hi>q. d.</hi> I write to you Young men becauſe ye are ſtrong, and have overcome the wicked one, <hi>i. e.</hi> you have thus far, hitherto, to this day reſiſted and kept your ground and have not given place to the Devil, you have ſtood it out againſt all his wiles and ſubtleties, you have made him flee by the power of the Word of God which made you ſtrong in Faith, the grace which is in Chriſt Jeſus; and this your ſtrength abides with you, as it did with <hi>Caleb, Joſh.</hi> 14.11. So that if the Devil ſet on you any more, you know how to conquer by the ſame Word again. Go on thou mighty man in this thy might, for the Lord of Hoſts is with thee, go on conquering and to conquer, go and proſper. Keep on your Armour, lay not aſide your Sword nor your Shield, for perhaps the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will rally his ſcattered forces and fall on again. Or he is it may be preparing other
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:43845:184"/>kind of temptations for you, <hi>viz.</hi> ſufferings and death as he did for Chriſt; but you (as he) ſhall riſe again and live for ever, and be where Satan hath had no place for ſome thouſands of years, nor never ſhall any more, <hi>viz.</hi> in Heaven; and by not loving your lives to the death, you conquer the Devil again, as Chriſt alſo did, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. And thus I have evinced that the Young men have overcome the wicked one and ſhall for ever. I now paſs on to the other things which relate to this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and then ſhall the Young men triumph.</p>

               <p>HAving already clear'd the Young mans vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to be by ſtrength, and his ſtrength to be from the Word of God abiding in him, I ſhall joyn theſe two Chapters or Heads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhew therein how the Word of God conduceth to their ſtrength, and how their ſtrength conduceth to the victory.</p>
               <p>As we ſhould faint if we did not believe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. and that fainting would prove our ſtrength of Faith to be but ſmall, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.10. So our Faith would faint were it not upheld and quickened by the Word of God: this I might evince from the ſeveral accounts I gave of the Word of God, and how it might be underſtood
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:43845:185"/>in the Text in relation to the Young mens ſtrength and victory; but I ſhall now conſider it only in the general, which will be applicable enough to each particular acceptation of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in before. To this purpoſe 'tis not a little obſervable, how <hi>David</hi> (who was one of Gods Worthies) doth celebrate the Word of God in relation to this very thing, eſpecially in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. he tells us, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. that the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man clears and cleanſeth his way by taking heed thereto according to Gods Word; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. he hid Gods Word in his heart, that he might not ſin againſt him, <hi>v.</hi> 25. he begs for quickening according to his Word, ſo again, <hi>Ver.</hi> 107. and 154. this was his comfort in his affliction that Gods Word had quickened him, <hi>Ver.</hi> 50. and when his ſoul melted for heavineſs he prays to be ſtrengthened according to Gods Word, <hi>Ver.</hi> 28. His Word was a light unto his path, and a lamp to his feet, <hi>Ver.</hi> 105. And he had wherewith to anſwer him that reproach'd him (the accuſer of the Brethren) becauſe he truſted in his Word, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 41, 42. God was his hiding-place and Shield, for he hoped in his Word, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 114. and prays that his ſteps may be ordered in his Word, to this end, that not any iniquity might have dominion over him. <hi>Ver.</hi> 133. with many other paſſages to this effect, to declare the uſefulneſs of the Word of God for the ſtrengthening of him.</p>
               <p>The Word of God is true, yea 'tis truth; and (<hi>magna eſt veritas &amp; praevalebit</hi>) truth is ſtrong, ſtronger than the Devil who is a lyar (and a lie is weak) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.4. now this Word
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:43845:185"/>of truth diſcovers the Devils devices, falſehoods, ſophiſtries, methods, ſtratagems, and all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits: thus the Word of God ſtrengthens (<hi>removen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> prohibens)</hi> by taking away lets, impediments; and hindrances ſuch as are doubts and fears, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts and jealouſies; that the ſoul is no longer under a Spirit of Bondage again to fear, <hi>Rom;</hi> 8.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. and withall it comes in with counſels, comforts and quickenings (as in the forequoted <hi>Pſalm</hi>) all which are ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening things. Thus their eyes being opened and inlightened (as <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s were) by taſting this honey, they are ſtrong for the battel; and by Faith they ſee (as the Prophet's man did) more for them than there are againſt them; and therefore faint not, eſpecially while they look (as <hi>Moſes</hi> did) to inviſible things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 16,—18. and ſee a great recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and all things co-working for their good and glory. As the ſight and ſpeech of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral doth often quicken and animate his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; ſo doth a believing ſight of Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. and his Word puts life and courage into them, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.23. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16, 17. And Chriſt as he did caſt out, ſo doth he conquer the Devil by his Word. Our own ſayings an dreaſonings are weak &amp; will not do it (as 'twas in the caſe of the Sons of <hi>Sceva, Act.</hi> 19.13,—16.) but when the Word of God ſpeaks, 'tis effectual, and the Devil cannot ſtand before it. Again,</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Word ſtrengthens Faith, ſo ſtrength of Faith conduceth to and obtains the victory; the reaſon is, becauſe where Faith is, God is, and where God is, there is ſtrength, and ſuch as
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:43845:186"/>againſt which none can prevail. Hence had the Heroes and Martyrs (mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) all their ſucceſs and victory. When <hi>Gideon</hi> had expreſt but a little Faith (not without a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of doubting) yet ſaith the Angel to him, <hi>Go in this thy might, the Lord is with thee, thou mighty may of valour,</hi> Judges 6.12,—14. If God be with us, it matters not who be againſt us; hence 'tis that the Saints of God (ſome of them) have out-braved men, Devils, dangers and death, as you may ſee in theſe following places, which I refer to your peruſal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9, 10. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.7,—9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 57. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. So that Faith is of huge uſe for conqueſt, ſeeing the victory (as the Eagle her prey) a far off, and is ſure of victory even in the midſt of the battel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. Thus then we have ſeen how the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men overcome the wicked one; and how great this victory is I am now to diſcover.</p>

                  </gap> you with the formidableneſs of the enemy that is overcome; 'Tis no puny, no petty pigmie that is conquered but an huge Giant, a man of war from his youth, who hath ſlain many a ten thouſand in his time. 'Tis an eafie matter to tread a worm under foot (and man is no more,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:43845:186"/>or very little more, but fleſh and blood, which is weak) but to tread Satan underfoot (the Prince of the Air, and God of this world; as ſome underſtand the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.) is a conqueſt with a witneſs, a ſignal one! To enter a City (ſuch as <hi>Laiſh</hi> was) without Gates and bars is no great archievement; but to attaque the Gates of Hell and to put the Devil to flie from his ſtrong holds, is a miracle of Victory! ſtronger is he that ſubdueth this Spirit (as well as his own) than he that takes a fenced City, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexanders</hi> conqueſts, and <hi>Julius Caeſars veni, vidi, vici,</hi> were nothing to this: <hi>Jobs</hi> conqueſt excels them all. I might illuſtrate it by the types in the Wars of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and inſtance eſpecially in <hi>Amalek</hi> &amp; <hi>Goliab,</hi> who were overcome by <hi>Joſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Caleb</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> the Young-men Saints of their generation: but I ſhall wave that, and take a view of this great <hi>Turk,</hi> the Devil, in and under theſe five Conſiderations. 1. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him in his ſtrength. 2. In his malice. 3. In his ſubtlety. 4. In his induſtry and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied pains-taking. 5. In his acquiſts and victories over many myriads: by all which it will appear how great and glorious this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us Conſider him in his ſtrength. He is the ſtrong man and the ſtrong man armed, and he that overcomes him needs be ſtrong indeed, as 'tis expreſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21, 22. He is the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion, which notes both his ſtrength and terribleneſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. and cannot be reſiſted but by being ſtrong in Faith, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. Befide,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:43845:187"/>they are legions, very many, and therefore are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the plural number and by words that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſtrength, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. Principalities, powers, ſpiritual wickedneſſes, and rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt whom we need go armed with the Armour of God, all the Armour of God and the power of his might, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10, 11, 13. They are ſpoken of in the abſtract, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible and in the dark, which makes them ſo much the more terrible. And yet theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers are not able to effect their deſign, but over them the Young men are more than conquerers, or as the word may be read, they do over-overcome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37, 38, 39. therefore the victory is great and glorious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us conſider the Devil in his malice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and envy. Who can ſtand before envy? he is the adverſary, the envious one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.28. and from this envy and enmity is the accuſer of the Brethren: and to be ſure, malice will do its worſt. He is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the reproacher and darter, and contrary to the Law of Arms he fights with poiſoned Arrows, with fiery darts, which are ſet on fire of Hell, poiſoned with the venome of envy and malice, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. His ſlanderous accuſations are ſuch as would burn up the Saints, were it not that the Shield of Faith doth quench them. He put God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on afflicting <hi>Job</hi> without a cauſe, he ſlandered <hi>Job,</hi> but <hi>Job</hi>'s Faith and patience overcame theſe fiery darts, which put him upon no leſs than to curſe God; they were thrown to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame his Spirit againſt God, but were quenched by Faith. Oh what a glorious victory 'tis to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:43845:187"/>conquer envy and malice it ſelf, whetted by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and enmity!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us conſider him in his ſubtlety. He is not only ſtrong and malicious (which doth ſtrengthen his ſtrength) but he is ſubtle too, which doth ſtrengthen his malice. He is the ſubtle Serpent; and if he were ſo ſubtle, when he was but young, as to deceive <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. what is he now he is grown old? the old Serpent (which hath deceiv'd the whole world in all Ages) <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9,—11. he is improved in ſubtlety by long pratice: he is a <hi>Proteus</hi> and <hi>Chamelion</hi> that can turn himſelf into any ſhape and colour; rather than fail, he will (though he cannot endure the light) turn himſelf into an Angel of Light, and hath got the knack and faculty of ſpeaking Scripture, he will cant in Scripture language, and fill his mouth full of good words and fair ſpeeches to deceive. He goes about (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) to circumvent and get advantages by the (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) many devices which he hath, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. the many fetches and catches which he hath ſtudied and practiſed theſe many years. He hath windings and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, methods of wiles, he is an old Fox, hath arts and tricks not a few, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. He is a crafts-maſter; though an enemy, yet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends friendſhip and good will, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2, 3. He will pretend himſelf much concern'd for us, yea more than we are for our ſelves (as he did at firſt) and as if he were troubled with ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of conſcience for our ſakes, he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Queries, and ask us if we do not miſtake
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:43845:188"/>God, and ſo take leſs liberty and enjoy leſs good, than God allows us, or at leaſt than may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to, by but taking a ſtep in the way that he will ſhew us, that we may be Gods forſooth; but he means ſuch <hi>Elohim</hi> as himſelf and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>i.e.</hi> Devils. He hath lying wonders in readineſs to ape Gods true miracles, as in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> He can juggle and play Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to purpoſe, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. In ſhort, he is a deep Politician, for we read of the depths of Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. Now to conquer ſuch an one requires ſtrength, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10, 11. and the Young men are they who conquer him; and 'tis a great victory!</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us conſider him in his conſtant and unwearied induſtry: The Phariſees and Jeſuits though very near of kin to him and well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and follow him (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) in compaſſing Sea and Land to make Proſelytes, do yet fall ſhort of him, for he is night and day <hi>walking about ſicking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. He takes no reſt in the night nor will ſuffer others to reſt night or day. Now add this to the reſt, his induſtry to his ſtrength, malice and art, and it inhaunceth the Victory not a little, I will mention but one thing more, and that is.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His acqueſts and victories which he hath obtain'd in all Ages; alas, how many have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len down at his leet! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this victory is the more glorious, conſidering the advantages the Devil hath over us as a ſpirit thus qualified with ſtrength, malice and art, thus fleſh'd with ſucceſs.

               <p>PErhaps ſome will be apt to ſay, That this is but a Romantick ſtory, a kind of Knight-Errantry, 'tis but for talk and diſcourſe, where are the erected Pillars, and the trophies of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that ſhould witneſs the Victory? where is <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword and head? where are the ſpoiles and the booty, the ſigns of their victory? <hi>But hear ye deſpiſers and wonder, for we have not brought to you a fiction or a cunningly deviſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but words of truth and power,</hi> as ſhall be yet further evinced. And ſeeing we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly paralleled the Temptations which Chriſt did and theſe Young men alſo did undergo and conquer after the witneſs of the Spirit received, we ſhall now parallel the ſigns and tokens of their reſpective victories.</p>
               <p>When our Saviour was tempted and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils thruſt put by and his argument defeated, he wholly waves the aſſuming of it, and ſhifts his ground as not able to ſtand upon it nor to it;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:43845:189"/>which is one ſign of his being ſo far conquer'd. He attempts the ſecond time another way but with no better ſucceſs, and therefore ſounds a parle and comes to treat; which is another ſign that his Forces fail'd him: when he can do no good (no evil) this way neither, he doth not only retreat but run away aſham'd, as one that flees in Battel, as 'tis ſaid of them, a <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.3. ſo that the field was left to Chriſt Jeſus, and thereupon the Angels came and miniſtred to him, <hi>i.e.</hi> did him homage as to a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, ſinging and celebrating his praiſe, as we have cauſe to believe. After this our Saviour went in the power of the Spirit (into <hi>Galilee</hi>) like a conqueror that had won the day and night go where he would, as 'tis remarked concerning him, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.14, 15. Though the Devil at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to invalidate the witneſs of the Spirit, yet he went in the power of the Spirit and that Teſtimony ever after, it being not at all weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the encounter: but went up and down teaching his Goſpel and giving forth his Laws, yea delivering Captives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it follows, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18.

But here alſo Chriſt was too hard for him, for though the Devil bruiſed his heel,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:43845:189"/>yet Chriſt brake the Devils head, according to the firſt Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. by dying he did deſtroy him that had the power of death, <hi>viz.</hi> the Devil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. and accordingly keeps the Keys to this day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. ſo that the Devil was hugely out in his Politicks, and was never ſo much defeated (as now) ſince he was a Devil: for when Chriſt was Crucified he ſpoil'd principalities and powers, triumphing over them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14, 15. So that now the Saints need not fear either Law, Death or Devil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55,—57. Yet further, our Saviour not only roſe from the dead (and ſo was declared to be the Son of God) with a (<hi>non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante</hi>) notwithſtanding the Devils guard kept the Sepulchre; but he aſcended on high and rid in triumph through the Devils principality (the Air, of which he is Prince) and as the Devil could not hinder him from aſcending to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo nor his gifts from deſcending on men (another token of his victory and triumph) then, then 'twas that he led Captivity Captive, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 9.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEſides what flows from their having the witneſs of the Spirit, which is the ſame with that of the little Children, of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; there is a further influence from this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, which almoſt doubles their joy, love and obedience, it being another witneſs (as it were) or a confirmation of the former, an aſſured aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It fills them with joy and rejoycing in the Lord, that of him they make their boaſt and to him they give the glory all the day long. They rejoyce not only as the Diſciples did, that the Devils are ſubject to them, but that their names are written in the Book of Life, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17. They triumph in the praiſes of God, and ſay, <hi>Thanks be to God who hath given us the Victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When they erect an Altar, the name and Motto is, <hi>Jehova niſſi,</hi> the Lord my Banner, and the Lord my ſtrength; 'twas he that taught me to fight and gave me the victory: <hi>Not to us, not to us, but to thy name be all the glory.</hi> They ſet up their <hi>Eben-Ezer,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Hitherto the Lord hath helped us.</hi> They rejoyce in the Salvation of God, and in the name of their God they ſet up their Banners. They glory not in riches nor ſtrength, but in the Lord. In fine, I may tell you that they ſing the 18. <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:43845:191"/> 2. The Lord having given them reſt and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement (which is the conſequent and effect of victory) they do not only rejoyce and ſing ſongs; but they ſtudy what to return to the Lord for all his benefits; they dedicate all the ſpoiles to God; they ſtudy (as <hi>David</hi> did) to build an houſe for God, and lay up all they can as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it: they have friendſhip with <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> (the high Life) if I may allude or allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize, that he may aſſiſt in this great work, and they may live above where the way of life is to them that are wiſe, that their affections and converſation alſo may be in Heaven. They Court not the <hi>Dalilahs</hi> of this worlds pleaſure (as too many <hi>Samſon</hi>-like conquerors do) nor turn Laplins to luſt after their great ſucceſſes; but ſtudy to walk with God and to pleaſe him, yea therein to abound more and more till they walk worthy of him to all well-pleaſing. They put not God off with words and a Song, and then forget his works; but they give and live thanks to God, the fruit of their lips and of their lives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are exceeding humble and lowly towards their weak Brethren; they dare not Lord it over the Lords inheritance (their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) though but Babes: but they give them their helping hand, and communicate their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to them for their relief and aſſiſtance, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 6. If any be overtaken they indeavour to reſtore him with a Spirit of meekneſs: for theſe Souldiers are not proud like others and lifted up, but being ſpiritual they know tenderneſs, and are acquainted with the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:43845:191"/>heart of tempted ones, having been tempted themſelves; and ſo are conformable to their great High-Prieſt and Captain-General of their faith and victory, which to brave Souldiers is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies an obligation to meekneſs and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not a ſpur to ambition, nor a ſtirrup to pride. Yea though ſome Babes are apt to envy their attainment and glory, yet they pity them and bear (as well as bear with) their infirmities.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They keep Centinel and ſtrict watch, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and walking in their Armor (that of God) alwaies: they turn not their Swords into Plow-Shears, nor their Spears into pruning hooks, as if all were over, but they watch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their adverſary the Devil, and keep ſtrong guards, not knowing but that the Devil may fall on again; they are not ſecure, nor do they lay by their weapons, as if they ſhould know war no more.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From the experiences they have had they take courage and good heart of grace to truſt in God for the future, not in their Sword or in their Bow (though it like <hi>Joſephs</hi> abide in ſtrength). Though ſome Young men faint and Youths fail (by reaſon of preſumption) yet theſe wait on the Lord and renew their ſtrength, they mount up with wings as Egles, they run and are not weary, they walk and faint not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.30, 31. They look on paſt deliverances as earneſt of and ſecurity for future deliverances, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They intangle not themſelves with the affairs of this life, that they may pleaſe him who hath choſen them to be Souldiers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. They
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:43845:192"/>live above the luſts of the eye, the luſts of the fleſh and pride of life, the love of theſe things being inconſiſtent with the love of God: they make <hi>Moſes</hi> his choice, being come to Age as he was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24,—27. They (as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi>) will not ſtoop to take up (much leſs to take up with) theſe things which are below; this earth is for their feet to tread on, and not to ſet their hearts on; no, no, this is the victory whereby they overcome the world, even their Faith, which looks to higher and better things than this world hath any, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5.4, 5. Theſe charming and bewitching things have no power over them, but they go on from ſtrength to ſtrength till they appear before God in <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſay with <hi>David, Whom have I in Heaven but thee, there is none on earth that I can deſire in compariſon of thee,</hi> Pſal. 73.25.</p>
               <p>I have thus briefly gone over the things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and promiſed as to this Claſſis of Saints, the Young men; in relation to which (as to the former alſo) I have endeavoured to ſet out their conditions (not by gueſs and conjecture, but) as they are repreſented in the Scripture, and have choſen to wave ſpeaking to other things, as intermiſſions, deſertions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which our text did not at all lead us, nor hint us to take notice of. I ſhall ſhut up all with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication proper to this Subject, which ſpeaks firſt to the little Children to prepare for this War, and to the Young men to make good what is ſaid of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are ſtrong, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. AS for you little Children who have lived hitherto in the Fathers houſe and lain in his boſome, injoying his love without doubts or diſputes, let me beſpeak you to look for and to prepare for temptations: Satan makes chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges and deſires to winnow and ſift you (as he did <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Peter, &amp;c.</hi>) <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31. Therefore watch and pray leſt ye enter into temptation, and beg of God either not to lead you into temptation; or if he will and do (as the Spirit did Chriſt Jeſus) that he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to be tempted above your ſtrength, but that he will deliver you from the evil, or the evil one. Tell your Father that you have heard what a potent and ſubtle adverſary the Devil is, and that he throws fiery darts to inflame the hearts of Gods Children againſt their Father, and tempts them to worſhip Devils; which are ſuch horrid things, as you would not willingly be acquainted with; but if as he hath glorified his name, ſo he will glorifie it again, then ſay, <hi>Father, thy Will be done</hi> (as your Saviour did) and conclude that your Father will not leave you nor forſake you, that you ſhould be a prey to this mighty, and a captive to this ſtrong one. If you ſhould any of you be called out to this War, take theſe encouragements for your help.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The cauſe is good, called the <hi>good fight
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:43845:193"/>of Faith (libertas agitur; pro aris &amp; focis)</hi> the Devil would turn you out of houſe and home, and deprive you of your right and title to Heaven; 'tis about heavenly things this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. and whether ye be the Sons of God or no? In other wars the cauſe is none of the beſt, nay many times very bad; but this is clear and without exception, that we ſhould fight againſt the Devil (and all his works) which wars againſt our comforts, ſouls and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Fear not then but fight, for your Cauſe is good and juſt. 'Tis to defend your own rights and liberties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Battel is the Lords; this <hi>Goliah</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies not only <hi>Iſrael</hi> but the living God; in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling your title into queſtion, he calls the truth of God and the witneſs of his Spirt into queſtion, ſo that God is engaged with you, and will plead his as well as your Cauſe, and will be jealous for his name and for his people: you fight for God, and therefore God will fight for you. As you may be ſaid to help the Lord againſt the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo the Lord will help you againſt their might: <hi>This day</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Goliah</hi>) <hi>will the Lord deliver thee into my hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, for the Battel it the Lords,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.46, 47. If the Lord be with us, it matters not who be againſt us, the gates (power and policy) of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: no, not Death it ſelf; for that <hi>Grotius</hi> underſtands by the gates of Hell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You fight under ſuch a Captain-General (Jeſus Chriſt) as never turn'd his back, was never foil'd, but went alwaies on conquering and to conquer. <hi>Nil deſperandum, Chriſto duce
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:43845:193"/>&amp; auſpice Chriſto,</hi> Look to Jeſus who is the leader and bringer up, the Author and will be the finiſher of your Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, 3. This great Commander doth not ſay (<hi>ite</hi> but <hi>venite</hi>) go and fight, but follow me: and 'tis alwaies an huge incouragement to bear Arms and fight under the conduct of a ſucceſsful General.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You are to fight with an enemy that hath been conquered by Chriſt Jeſus, and by many of your Brethren: the Devil is not ſo dreadful as he was before Chriſt died, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. The Prince of peace hath conquered the King of terrors; and many of your Brethren have confuted and defeated him many times. 'Tis true his wiles are his worſt weapons, and his wit is more than his might, yet 'tis true his ill-will and malice is more than his wit, and he hath been befool'd many a time notwithſtanding all his cunning devices, and put to ſhame for his malicious lying, as in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe and many others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You are provided with Armor of proof (Armor of Gods making as well as of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing) and 'tis ſuch as there is none ſuch, none like it. You have the ſame Sword that Jeſus Chriſt, and the Young men your Brethren have conquered the Devil by; and the ſame Shield of Faith to quench his fiery darts with; this Armour is mighty through God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God will take care for your pay, you ſhall not war at your own charges, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the glory of overcoming, you ſhall have a Crown of glory after you have overcome, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. To him that overcometh God will give honour, for they that honour him he
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:43845:194"/>will honor; their labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58.</p>
               <p n="7">7. God hath promiſed you ſucceſs and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory <hi>(certus enim Promiſit Apollo)</hi> he will tread Saran under <hi>your</hi> feet ſhortly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. He ſhall be caſt out, and you ſhall overcome him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9, 10, 11. Read the 41. of <hi>Iſay,</hi> from the eighth to the ſeventeenth Verſe, that through the comfort of that, as other Scriptures alſo (written for our conſolation) you may have hope and ſtrong conſolation.</p>
               <p>Well then, be ſtrong in the Lord and the power of his might, for by no other ſtrength do any or can you prevail: though it be ſaid that by ſtrength ſhall no man prevail, yet by ſtrength do all men prevail, 'tis an Orthodoxe Paradoxe. By ſtrength no man nor Devil ſhall or can prevail againſt God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8,—10. Let no man therefore provoke the Lord to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, for he hath no match, he is ſtronger than all, and none ſhall take his Saints out of his hand; who ever fought againſt God and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered? but there is a ſtrength of Faith and Prayer (like <hi>Jacobs</hi>) by which ſome prevail with God, and they are Princes the true <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, Hoſ.</hi> 12.3, 4. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24,—28. When God yields we prevail with him; and when we yield not but are ſtrong in the Lord, reſiſting the Devil, we prevail over him. 'Tis by no ſtrength but by Chriſt ſtrengthening us that we can do all things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. 'Tis not by ſtrength of wit or reaſon, not by ſtrength of hands or legs, or ſtrength of our Spirit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but by the ſtrength of God, of his Word,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:43845:194"/>Grace and Spirit abiding in us that we prevail.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Young men, I have no more to ſay but to exhort them to make good what hath been ſaid of them in all particulars. Make it appear that you are ſtrong, that the Word of God abideth in you, that you have overcome the evil one, which will prove that God is your God and Father, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. and that none ſhall ſeparate you from the Love of God in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ult. ſhew the tokens and ſigns of your Victory, let the diſpoſitions and converſations of Young men be apparent in your lives, holding forth the Word of Life and power in the works of your lives; that ſo you may grow up to be Fathers in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and gray-hair'd in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which will be to you a Crown of glory, as ſtrength was your glory while you were Young men. Live and thrive like them that eat, digeſt and concoct ſtrong meat (that feed on the eternal Love of God, and the Prieſthood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) which belongs to the little Children, to you and to the Fathers, who (all in your ſeveral meaſures) by reaſon of uſe (or habit) have your ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern between good and evil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14.</p>

For though there may be ſome Heteroclita <hi>(quae genus &amp; flexum variant)</hi> ſome random-Saints, if I may ſo ſpeak, that are not fixed but fleeting; yet theſe alſo may be reduced (as to their ſtate in general) to one or other Claſſis for the moſt part.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a great advantage (in many reſpects) to know where one is: to know ones place, rank and ſtation: as 'tis for a Servant in a Family, or a Souldier in an Army. They that know not what their work is, know not how to do their work; but if we know our ſtation, our work (both what and how to be done) is clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and we may up and be doing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though a Saint ſhould be content with his preſent ſtate, yet but for the preſent; he ſhould deſire and pray, breath and pant, he ſhould hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt, indeavour and labour after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and preferment. Though he ſhould not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to bleſs God for, yet he ſhould forget (what is behind) to reſt in, what he hath; and not think that he hath attained ſo much, or were already ſo perfect, as if there were no more to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; reaching and preſſing forward (as <hi>Paul</hi> did) is the duty of all, till they attain to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead. There's no ſtate on earth ſo ſatisfying as ſhould take a man off from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; haſtning to the coming of Chriſt, that we may be alwaies with him and altogether like
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:43845:196"/>him, <hi>Phil</hi> 1.23. 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11,—13. The good and bad things and conditions in this world call upon us to long to be above in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; For, if it be bad to be here, 'tis good to be there; if it be good to be here, 'tis better to be there, to be ſure: though we may have enough ſometime to ſay, 'Tis good to be here, yet we have never enough to ſay, 'Tis beſt to be here.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſhould all take heed and beware that we do not place our growth and advance, only in knowledge (head and Book learning) nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in gifts and parts, nor only in common graces; no, nor in going from one opinion to another, or one form of Church-Government to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from one profeſſion to another; this I fear hath been a great miſtake, as if it were a going on to, when (alas! if this be all!) 'tis a going from perfection: for to be toſſed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine, is but babiſh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13,—16. Alas! what is't to be Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> our Religion lies not, much leſs our perfection, in theſe or any other opinions, and forms of Government. I doubt not but there are Saints in all theſe Forms, yet withal I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and affirm that none of theſe Forms make them Saints; a man may be in any of theſe and yet be but a Babe, yea and not be a Babe but carnal. This is but like them that go up and down the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> crying, Old Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin and ends of Gold and Silver, by which they never grow rich, nor get any conſiderable eſtate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We ſhould be as careful to mind and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duties as to enjoy the priviledges
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:43845:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>and dignities of our ſtate; and mind not only to be in Chriſt but to walk in him and as he walked. Study commands as well as promiſes, and look after light that ye may walk in the light; for if we walk in the light (as children of light) we have fellowſhip one with another (<hi>i. e.</hi> God and we have.) Thus as God glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies us, we glorifie him, for which we ſhould have a great ambition; yea, and to let our light ſo ſhine before men, that they alſo may glorifie our Father which is in Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.13,—16. Let us live in love, and truth it in love, for oh how good and pleaſant a thing it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity! Let us not be like <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> to envy and vex, to bite and devour one another; but love one another with a pure heart fervently. In fine, let us make it our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs (and our pleaſure too) to adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour, and to walk worthy of God to all-well-pleaſing: to which end, <hi>Let us grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, that to him</hi> (and to the Father by him) <hi>there may be thanks and glory given, both now and for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
